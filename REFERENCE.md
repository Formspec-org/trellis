## `thoughts/product-vision.md`

**H1 — Formspec + WOS + Trellis — Product Vision & Roadmap**
Authoritative product roadmap: three-tier framing (Formspec / WOS / Trellis), four-phase delivery arc, 15 non-negotiable Phase 1 envelope invariants, ledger/log vocabulary, tracks A–E.

| H2 | Summary |
|----|---------|
| The vision, in one sentence | Single-sentence pitch tying intake → adjudication → air-gapped-verifiable appellate record. |
| The product | Three tiers, their roles, and the coherent composition claim. |
| Who it's for | Federal/state public-sector intake, regulated enterprise, adjacent privacy-forward markets. |
| Why it wins | Competitive framing against Adobe AEM Forms, ServiceNow, and DocuSign. |
| How we build — the operating model | Agreement-first sequencing, specs-as-prompt-guidance, the closed loop with per-spec centers of gravity. |
| Current state (honest assessment) | Status matrix for Formspec / WOS / Trellis across agreement, spec, schema, lint, conformance, runtime, tools. |
| Delivery arc | Four phases + "Terminology — ledger vs log" + **Phase 1 envelope invariants (non-negotiable)** (#1–#15) + per-phase descriptions. |
| Non-goals | Explicit list (not a BPM engine, not an identity platform, not DMS, not BI, not a cost play). |
| Next steps — the concrete plan | Tracks A (Trellis from zero), B (in-flight specs/runtimes), C (first-sale certs), D (engineering), E (cross-cutting bindings). |
| The unifying test | The stranger-test acceptance bar. |
| The single-sentence pitch | External framing for Trellis + WOS + Formspec together. |

## `specs/trellis-agreement.md`

**H1 — Trellis Agreement Document**
Non-normative sign-off gate. Names scope, primitives, invariants, seams, delivery shape, and success criterion precisely enough that a sign-off here either proceeds or blocks the rest of Track A.

| H2 | Summary |
|----|---------|
| 1. Purpose | What Trellis is, why now, the two already-written deferrals (Respondent Ledger §13, WOS §10.5) it answers. |
| 2. Scope | IS/IS-NOT bullets; non-goals verbatim from the product vision. |
| 3. Primitives | One-line definitions: event, envelope, chain, checkpoint, export bundle, signature, response ledger, case ledger, agency log, federation log. |
| 4. Trust posture | "Difficult and obvious," not "system-owner-proof." Per-phase bar from Phase 1 (bundle reissue detectable) to Phase 4 (equivocation-proof via witness). |
| 5. Phase 1 non-negotiable invariants | All 15 invariants in `#N title — essence` form with RFC 2119 MUST/MUST NOT language. |
| 6. Seams | Respondent Ledger §13 `LedgerCheckpoint`, §6.2 `eventHash`/`priorEventHash`; WOS `custodyHook` §10.5; Track E §21 case-ledger / agency-log extension. |
| 7. Phase sequencing commitment | One sentence per phase; strict-superset claim anchored to invariants #10 and #12. |
| 8. Delivery shape | Two W3C specs (Core + Operational Companion) + ~50 vectors + Rust reference + CLI/WASM + independent second implementation. |
| 9. Out of scope for Phase 1 | Explicit list (external witnessing infra, BBS+ implementation, threshold custody, respondent-held keys, federation, PQ signature shipping). |
| 10. Success gate | Stranger-test verbatim. |
| 11. Sign-off | Two-line signature block. |

| H2 | Summary |
|----|---------|
| Abstract | Purpose, Phase 1 scope, and Phase 2/3 superset commitment. |
| Status of This Document | Phase 1 Core; Operational Companion is a separate normative document. |
| Table of Contents | Section navigation. |
| 1. Introduction | Three-scope terminology (event / response ledger / case ledger / agency log / federation log) and non-goals. |

| 3. Terminology | Glossary of normative nouns. |
| 4. Non-goals and authority boundaries | What Trellis Core does not specify; Formspec/WOS authority split. |
| 5. Canonical Encoding | **Invariant #1.** dCBOR (RFC 8949 §4.2.2 deterministic profile) pinned with CDDL. |
| 6. Event Format | CDDL for the atomic append unit; field-by-field normative definitions. |
| 7. Signature Profile | **Invariant #2.** Ed25519 over COSE_Sign1 (`alg = -8`); `suite_id` registry reserving ML-DSA / SLH-DSA / hybrid codepoints. |
| 8. Signing-Key Registry | **Invariant #3.** `SigningKeyEntry` with Active/Revoked lifecycle; registry snapshot embedded in exports. |
| 9. Hash Construction | **Invariant #4.** Encrypt-then-hash; domain separation tags; crypto-shredding semantics. |
| 10. Chain Construction | **Invariant #5.** Phase 1 strict linear `prev_hash`; reserved `causal_deps` field for Phase 2 HLC/DAG upgrade. |

| 12. Header Policy | **Invariant #9.** Enumeration of plaintext vs committed fields; declaration-table form. |
| 13. Commitment Slots Reserved | **Invariant #8.** CDDL reservation for Pedersen/Merkle per-field commitments; BBS+ implementation deferred. |
| 14. Registry Snapshot Binding | **Invariant #6.** Content-addressed digest of domain registry in export manifest. |
| 15. Snapshot and Watermark Discipline | **Invariant #14.** `(tree_size, tree_head_hash)` watermarks on derived artifacts and agency-log entries. |

| 19. Verification Algorithm | Step-by-step pseudocode; no network calls; time/memory bounds. |
| 20. Trust Posture Honesty | **Invariant #15.** `provider_readable` / `reader_held` / `delegated_compute` / `external_anchor_required` declaration; no overclaiming. |
| 21. Posture / Custody / Conformance-Class Vocabulary | **Invariant #11.** Three-namespace disambiguation; Respondent Ledger owns `Profile A/B/C`. |
| 22. Composition with Respondent Ledger | Track E §21(a) + §21(b); promotion of §6.2 `eventHash`/`priorEventHash` to MUST; case-ledger composition. |
| 23. Composition with WOS `custodyHook` | Track E §22; how WOS uses Trellis as custody backend. |
| 24. Agency Log (Phase 3 Superset Preview) | Agency log as log-of-case-ledger-heads; extension points reserved in Phase 1. |
| 25. Security and Privacy Considerations | Metadata leakage, equivocation, side channels, replay, key compromise, PQ migration, crypto-shred/backup interaction. |
| 26. IANA Considerations | `suite_id` registry request; content-type registration. |
| 27. Test Vector Requirements | ~50 vectors across `append / verify / export / tamper`; second-implementation byte-match gate. |

| 29. Appendix B — Example Events and Exports | Hex CBOR + decoded dCBOR worked examples. |
| 30. Traceability Anchors | TR-CORE-NNN row anchors for cross-reference from the matrix. |
| 31. References | Normative + informative. |

**Known issues (handoff Group A):** §7.4 uses a custom "signature field zeroed" scheme instead of RFC 9052 `Sig_structure`; hash preimages need explicit structures; `ciphertext_ref` payload-reference semantics ambiguous; ZIP determinism has a lexicographic-vs-manifest-first conflict; "strict superset" not yet defined as reserved-extension preservation; §24 agency-log extension points may need CDDL reservation in §11. Tracked in `thoughts/specs/2026-04-17-trellis-normalization-handoff.md`.

## `specs/cross-reference-map.md`

**H1 — Trellis Cross-Reference Map**
Living document recording upstream homes for concepts removed from Trellis specs when the three-spec dependency direction (Formspec ← WOS ← Trellis) was formalized. Implementation aid, not normative.

Reading order, authority claims, archive pointers for the `specs/` directory.

| H2 | Summary |
|----|---------|
| Reading Order | Agreement → Core → Operational Companion → Requirements Matrix. |

| Archived Inputs | Archive folder pointers for the superseded 8-spec family. |
| Checks | Lint invocation for `scripts/check-specs.py`. |

## `thoughts/specs/2026-04-17-trellis-normalization-handoff.md`

**H1 — Trellis Spec Normalization Handoff**
Outstanding architectural work ordered such that byte-protocol decisions land before cosmetic alignment.

| H2 | Summary |
|----|---------|
| Context | Directional alignment with vision; drift between vision and generated prose is the residual problem. |
| Verified findings | Three factual claims confirmed with file:line evidence (signature zero-fill, JCS-vs-dCBOR, stale Core §N refs). |
| Reasoning | Prose-first vs matrix-first tradeoff; prose-first adopted. |
| Tasks | Group A byte-protocol repair (1–7), Group B document hygiene (8–10), Group C vocabulary/traceability (11–13), Group D automation (14). |
| Acceptance Bar | Six concrete implementor-facing tests that make the handoff complete. |

## Heading-reference policy

- Active documents only. Archived files are deliberately omitted.
- When section numbers change, this file updates alongside the spec edit.
- `scripts/check-specs.py` enforces that `§N` cross-references resolve to headings that still exist.
