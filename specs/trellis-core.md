# Trellis Core Specification (Phase 1)

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** 2026-04-21
**Editors:** Formspec / WOS / Trellis Working Group
**Companion to:** Formspec Core v1.0, Formspec Respondent Ledger v0.1, WOS Kernel v1.0

## Abstract

Trellis is the cryptographic integrity substrate for the Formspec / WOS / Trellis stack. It specifies a byte-exact, append-only, offline-verifiable envelope format for individual **events** (atomic append units); hash-chained **response ledgers** (scoped to one Formspec Response); signed **checkpoints** over contiguous event ranges; and a deterministic **export package** that a stranger with only the package in hand can verify on an air-gapped laptop decades after it was produced. This document is the Phase 1 Core: it normatively fixes the wire format, the Ed25519/COSE_Sign1 signature profile, the dCBOR canonical encoding, the SHA-256 hash construction, the signing-key registry, the HPKE Base-mode payload-key wrap, the reserved commitment and causal-dependency slots, the append idempotency contract, the export ZIP layout, and the verification algorithm. Phase 2 runtime-integrity behavior and Phase 3 case-ledger / agency-log composition are strict supersets of this core by using reserved extension containers; they do not redefine the event payload or checkpoint payload. The Trellis Operational Companion covers projection discipline, metadata budgets, and posture-transition auditability; it is a separate normative document.

## Status of This Document

This is the **ratified Phase 1 Core** deliverable of the Trellis specification family: the constitutional byte-level substrate on which Phase 2 runtime integrity and Phase 3 portable case files are built. The Phase-1 stranger test is closed: an independent implementation, reading only this document and the cited normative references, produced byte-identical output against the committed fixture corpus (§29).

Operational guarantees that depend on live system behavior — projection snapshot policy, metadata-budget declaration tables, posture-transition auditability, rights-impacting evaluator rebuild — are normatively delegated to the **Trellis Operational Companion** (Phase 2 deliverable), which is a separate document. This core does not block on the companion: Phase 1 ships complete without it.

This core may be cited in production procurement. Previous `thoughts/archive/drafts/*` material and earlier split-out companion drafts now archived under `specs/archive/` are consolidated and superseded by this file for all Phase 1 normative purposes. Where the earlier documents contained material that is operational rather than constitutional, that material migrates to the Operational Companion and not to this document.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 What Trellis is

Formspec captures what a respondent answered. WOS governs the workflow that adjudicates it. Trellis is the layer that makes the resulting record **survive the system, the vendor, and the years**. A Trellis envelope is the smallest atomic unit of attested record in the stack: one COSE_Sign1 signature over a deterministically encoded CBOR object whose content hash is taken over ciphertext, whose signing key is resolvable against an export-embedded key registry, and whose append position is attested by a signed checkpoint over the preceding tree.

Trellis is not a workflow engine. It is not an identity platform. It is not an orchestrator. It is the integrity substrate against which three levels of Formspec / WOS structure compose.

### 1.2 Three scopes of append-only structure

This stack uses three nested scopes of append-only structure. Every requirement in this specification is qualified by scope.

- **Event.** An atomic append: one field edit, one governance action, one signature. Defined in §6.
- **Response ledger.** A hash-chained sequence of events for one Formspec Response. Sealed at submission. Phase 1's primary scope.
- **Case ledger.** A hash-chained sequence of governance events composing one or more sealed response-ledger heads with WOS governance events into one adjudicatory matter. Phase 3. Its event format is this specification's event format; its head format is a strict superset of this specification's checkpoint format (§24).
- **Agency log.** An operator-maintained log whose *entries* are case-ledger heads plus arrival metadata and optional witness signatures. Phase 3. Structurally CT-style; it proves that a case existed at time T and was not quietly deleted.
- **Federation log.** A log of agency-log heads witnessed by an independent operator. Phase 4.

Throughout this document, "ledger" is always qualified by scope. "Log" is reserved for structures whose entries are other ledgers' heads. All five are Trellis-shaped: same envelope, same hash, same signing profile, different scopes.

### 1.3 Non-goals

This specification does not define:

- workflow semantics (those live in WOS),
- form data-capture semantics (those live in Formspec),
- storage backends (Postgres, blob stores, object stores are implementation choices),
- transport protocols (HTTPS, mTLS, gRPC, IPFS are transport choices),
- post-quantum cryptography as a Phase 1 shipping requirement (§7.3 reserves the seam; Phase 1 ships Ed25519),
- a BBS+ / Pedersen selective-disclosure implementation (§13 reserves the slots; implementation deferred to Phase 2+),
- legal admissibility in any jurisdiction (§20).

### 1.4 Phase supersetting commitment

**The Phase 1 envelope IS the Phase 3 case-ledger event format.** Phase 2 and Phase 3 are strict supersets: they add runtime attestation (Phase 2) and case-scoped composition (Phase 3); they do not redefine the event. Later phases add data only through reserved extension containers defined in §6 and §11, and preserve the Phase 1 payload fields byte-for-byte. Phase 1 verifiers reject unknown top-level payload fields; forward compatibility comes from registered extension containers, not from accepting arbitrary top-level data. This is a normative commitment (§6.5 MUST-clause).

---

## 2. Conformance

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **NOT RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL** in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 ([RFC 2119], [RFC 8174]) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals as shown here.

### 2.1 Conformance classes

An implementation MAY claim one or more of the following conformance classes. A claim MUST satisfy every requirement applicable to each claimed class.

1. **Fact Producer.** Produces signed events. Typical: Formspec respondent client, WOS governance runtime.
2. **Canonical Append Service.** Admits events into canonical order, forms a Merkle tree over event hashes, issues signed checkpoints.
3. **Verifier.** Validates an export package offline.
4. **Derived Processor.** Builds projections from canonical truth. (Snapshot and rebuild discipline in §15; full operational detail in the Operational Companion.)
5. **Export Generator.** Assembles export packages that a Verifier can validate without network access.

Phase 1 conformance for each class requires satisfying every MUST in every section of this document tagged to that class. A second implementation that passes the fixture suite of §29 demonstrates conformance as the class(es) it implements.

### 2.2 RFC 2119 scope

RFC 2119 keywords in this document govern byte-level wire format (§§5–11), verifier behavior (§19), export contents (§18), and the trust-posture honesty floor (§20). They do not govern UX, transport, storage backend choice, or any matter explicitly delegated to a companion.

---

## 3. Terminology

- **Event.** The atomic append unit defined by §6.
- **Canonical event hash.** The SHA-256 digest over the dCBOR-encoded `CanonicalEventHashPreimage` under domain separator `trellis-event-v1` (§9.2).
- **Prior event hash.** The canonical event hash of the immediately preceding event in the same response ledger (§10.2).
- **Content hash.** The SHA-256 digest over the ciphertext body of an event's payload (§9.3). Computed over ciphertext so that per-subject key destruction (crypto-shredding) erases the payload without invalidating the chain.
- **`suite_id`.** Registered identifier for the full signature suite (curve + signature algorithm + digest) used on a given event, checkpoint, or manifest (§7). It is carried in the COSE protected header.
- **`kid`.** Signing-key identifier, unique within the signing-key registry of an export (§8.2). It is carried in the COSE protected header.
- **Payload reference.** A tagged reference to encrypted payload bytes: either inline ciphertext with nonce, or a content-addressed external ciphertext reference (§6.4).
- **Signing-key registry.** The append-only registry of `SigningKeyEntry` records embedded in every export (§8).
- **Key bag.** Per-event set of HPKE-wrapped content-encryption keys, one per recipient (§9.4).
- **`LedgerServiceWrapEntry`.** Append-only record of a service-side re-wrap after a Long-lived Authority Key rotation (§8.6); does not mutate the original event's `key_bag` or canonical event hash.
- **Canonical append attestation.** A signed checkpoint plus an inclusion proof that a given event hash appears at a given position in the canonical tree.
- **Checkpoint.** A COSE_Sign1 whose payload is a `CheckpointPayload` over a ledger scope and tree head (§11).
- **Tree head hash.** The Merkle root over the sequence of canonical event hashes up to `tree_size`, under the RFC-6962-compatible construction of §11.3.
- **Watermark.** The tuple `(tree_size, tree_head_hash)` identifying the canonical state from which a derived artifact or agency-log entry was built (§15).
- **Idempotency key.** A stable, caller-supplied, opaque identifier of up to 64 bytes, or a UUIDv7, that identifies an append attempt (§17).
- **Export package.** A deterministic ZIP with the contents of §18.
- **Response ledger / case ledger / agency log / federation log.** See §1.2.
- **Conformance class.** See §2.1. Legacy drafts called these "profiles"; this document renames them to eliminate the tri-namespace overload (§21).
- **Custody model.** See §21. The legacy companion draft's "Profiles A–E" (provider-readable / reader-held / delegated / threshold / organizational) are renamed "Custody Models" here.
- **Posture.** See §21. The Respondent Ledger spec's Profile A/B/C letters name posture axes (privacy × identity × integrity-anchoring); Trellis refers to them as "Respondent Ledger Profile A/B/C" without renaming. Their normative home remains Respondent Ledger §15A.

When a normative clause below uses one of these terms, it means exactly what is defined here — not the same term as it may appear in `thoughts/archive/drafts/` material or in superseded drafts.

---

## 4. Non-goals and authority boundaries

This Phase 1 core does not extend or reinterpret semantics owned by other specifications. The following cross-repo authority boundary is normative.

- **Formspec** is authoritative for Definition structure, Response semantics, FEL evaluation, validation algorithm, relevance and calculation, version pinning, and the four-phase processing model. Trellis does not restate those; a `formspec.authored` event is a Trellis envelope wrapping a Formspec artifact whose meaning is fixed by Formspec.
- **WOS** is authoritative for actor model, case state, deontic governance, autonomy caps, and workflow runtime semantics. A `wos.governance` event is a Trellis envelope wrapping a WOS artifact whose meaning is fixed by WOS.
- **Trellis** is authoritative for the envelope bytes, the hash chain, the checkpoint format, the export package, and the verification algorithm — and for nothing else. The Trellis verifier does not evaluate Formspec validation rules, it does not run WOS deontic checks, and it does not decide workflow outcomes. It verifies integrity and provenance distinctions; the admissibility of what it attests to remains bound to Formspec and WOS.

Trellis-bound Formspec processors MUST implement at least Formspec Core conformance. Trellis-bound WOS runtimes MUST implement at least WOS Kernel conformance. Where Trellis behavior depends on Formspec Definition or Response semantics (for example, version-pinning determinism, calculated-field provenance), processing MUST be delegated to a Formspec-conformant processor; Trellis MUST NOT restate the Formspec rule.

---

## 5. Canonical Encoding

**Requirement class:** Fact Producer, Canonical Append Service, Verifier, Export Generator.

### 5.1 Pinned encoding: dCBOR

All Trellis byte-level structures — events, checkpoints, signing-key registry entries, export manifests, inclusion proofs, consistency proofs — are serialized as **deterministic CBOR (dCBOR)**, which for this specification means the Core Deterministic Encoding profile of [RFC 8949] §4.2.2:

- Integers encoded in the smallest possible representation (no leading zero-length prefixes).
- Map keys sorted in byte-wise lexicographic order of their canonical CBOR encoding; duplicate keys rejected.
- No indefinite-length items (all arrays, maps, byte strings, text strings use definite-length encoding).
- Floating-point values, if used, encoded as the shortest form that round-trips to the same value; NaN and infinities rejected in all fields normatively defined here.
- Byte strings (`bstr`) used for all binary material; text strings (`tstr`) used only for human-readable identifiers.

Implementations MUST NOT emit non-deterministic CBOR. A record that does not round-trip byte-for-byte through a conformant dCBOR encoder is not a canonical record.

### 5.2 Reproducibility requirement

Every byte-level test vector in the fixture suite of §29 MUST reproduce byte-for-byte on a second, independent implementation. Cross-implementation byte-match is the success criterion for this encoding choice. An implementation that produces semantically-equivalent-but-byte-different output is non-conformant; dCBOR exists precisely to remove that latitude.

### 5.3 CDDL grammar fragment

All structured types in this specification are described by [RFC 8610] CDDL. The authoritative grammar is in Appendix A (§28); each section below gives the fragment relevant to that section.

```cddl
; Canonical encoding base type.
; All bstr fields are raw bytes; tstr fields are UTF-8.
; All maps are encoded dCBOR per §5.1.
canonical-bytes = bytes  ; dCBOR-encoded
digest = bstr .size 32   ; SHA-256, 32 bytes
```

---

## 6. Event Format

**Requirement class:** Fact Producer (produces), Canonical Append Service (admits), Verifier (validates), Export Generator (includes).

### 6.1 Normative structure

An **event** is the atomic append unit. Every append to any Trellis-shaped structure (response ledger, case ledger, agency log, federation log) is one event. On the wire an event is a COSE_Sign1 object whose protected headers identify the signing suite and key, and whose payload is the dCBOR encoding of `EventPayload`.

```cddl
Event = COSESign1Bytes ; RFC 9052 COSE_Sign1 tagged CBOR value.

EventPayload = {
  version:           uint .size 1,          ; wire-format version, = 1 for Phase 1
  ledger_scope:      bstr,                  ; replay boundary, §10.4
  sequence:          uint,                  ; monotonic within ledger scope
  prev_hash:         digest / null,         ; §10; null only for sequence == 0
  causal_deps:       [* digest] / null,     ; §10.3 reserved; null or [] in Phase 1
  author_event_hash: digest,                ; §9.5; excludes itself and signatures
  content_hash:      digest,                ; SHA-256 over ciphertext, §9.3
  header:            EventHeader,           ; §12
  commitments:       [* Commitment] / null, ; §13 reserved
  payload_ref:       PayloadRef,            ; inline or external ciphertext, §6.4
  key_bag:           KeyBag,                ; §9.4
  idempotency_key:   bstr .size (1..64),    ; §17
  extensions:        { * tstr => any } / null, ; reserved top-level extension container
}
```

An `EventPayload` is a CBOR map with exactly these keys. Additional top-level keys are reserved for future phases and MUST NOT be emitted by Phase 1 producers; Phase 1 verifiers encountering an unknown top-level key MUST reject the event. Additive extension is performed via `EventPayload.extensions` and `EventHeader.extensions`, which are explicitly reserved for forward-compatible growth.

`idempotency_key` is a stable, caller-supplied byte string whose uniqueness scope is the pair `(ledger_scope, idempotency_key)` (§17.3): within a given `ledger_scope`, a specific `idempotency_key` value identifies exactly one canonical event forever. A Fact Producer MUST construct `idempotency_key` by a rule that produces equal bytes for equivalent authored submissions and distinct bytes otherwise; the recommended construction is a UUIDv7 ([RFC 9562]), with a deterministic hash of the authored fact's causal identity permitted where retry semantics require it (§17.2). The size bound `.size (1..64)` is structural; the uniqueness and construction obligations above are the normative value-level discipline.

### 6.2 Sequence and prev_hash

- `sequence` is a non-negative integer, monotonic within ledger scope. The first event in a ledger has `sequence = 0`.
- `ledger_scope` is the response-ledger, case-ledger, agency-log, or federation-log identifier. It is signed and hashed so a genesis event or copied event cannot replay into another scope.
- `prev_hash` is `null` if and only if `sequence == 0`. Otherwise it MUST be the canonical event hash (§9.2) of the immediately preceding event in the same `ledger_scope`.
- Phase 1 chain construction is strict linear (§10). `causal_deps` MUST be either `null` or the empty array `[]` in Phase 1 events.

### 6.3 author_event_hash

`author_event_hash` is the integrity digest of the author-originated portion of the event: the signed envelope, the ciphertext, and the key bag at the moment of signing. It is computed per §9.5 and MUST NOT change after signing, even under service-side key rotation (§8.6).

### 6.4 content_hash over ciphertext

`content_hash` is `SHA-256` over the exact ciphertext bytes named by `payload_ref`. This hash is over **ciphertext, not plaintext** (§9.3). This choice is load-bearing for crypto-shredding: destroying the per-subject content-encryption key erases the plaintext without invalidating the hash chain, because verification checks the ciphertext hash and the signature — neither of which depends on plaintext.

`payload_ref` is one of two tagged structures:

```cddl
PayloadRef = PayloadInline / PayloadExternal

PayloadInline = {
  ref_type:   "inline",
  ciphertext: bstr,
  nonce:      bstr .size 12,
}

PayloadExternal = {
  ref_type:       "external",
  content_hash:   digest,
  availability:   AvailabilityHint,
  retrieval_hint: tstr / null,
}

AvailabilityHint = &(
  InExport:     0,  ; bytes are present in the export payload directory
  External:     1,  ; bytes are retrievable from a content-addressed external store
  Withheld:     2,  ; bytes intentionally omitted for disclosure/readability reasons
  Unavailable:  3,  ; bytes unavailable; verifier must report omitted checks
)
```

For `PayloadInline`, `content_hash` MUST equal the hash of `ciphertext`. When the payload is encrypted under the Phase 1 suite, `ciphertext` is the output of ChaCha20-Poly1305 over the plaintext payload using the 32-byte DEK, the `PayloadInline.nonce`, and zero-length associated data `aad = h''`. For `PayloadExternal`, `EventPayload.content_hash` MUST equal `PayloadExternal.content_hash`; if ciphertext bytes are not present in the export, an offline verifier reports that payload integrity and readability checks could not run (§19) rather than pretending they succeeded.

`PayloadInline.nonce` is pinned to a 12-byte `bstr` to match the ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD nonce size fixed by the Phase 1 HPKE suite in §9.4. A future HPKE suite registration (§9.4) that changes the AEAD algorithm MAY require a different nonce length; such a suite MUST introduce a replacement `PayloadRef` variant rather than silently widening this constraint.

### 6.5 Phase-superset extension points

The following extension points are reserved for Phase 2 / Phase 3 superset growth. Phase 1 producers MUST NOT populate them except as `null` or empty maps/lists, with one exception: the §6.7 registered-identifier carve-out — registered identifiers whose Phase column is `1` MAY be emitted by Phase 1 producers (§6.7 is authoritative for which specific keys). Phase 1 verifiers MUST accept empty containers and MUST process Phase 1 registered identifiers per each identifier's verification obligation. Phase 2+ producers MUST populate them according to later-phase specifications; Phase 1+Phase 2 bridge verifiers MUST reject records whose extension-point usage violates this specification.

- `causal_deps` — Phase 2 HLC / DAG causal ordering.
- `commitments` — Phase 2+ per-field redaction-aware commitments (§13).
- `EventPayload.extensions` — additive top-level event metadata without top-level field growth.
- `header.extensions` — additive header fields without a version bump (§12.3).
- `header.witness_ref` — Phase 4 transparency-witness references.

**Normative phase-superset commitment.** The byte shape produced by a Phase 1 Export Generator MUST be byte-identical to what a Phase 3 case-ledger event of the same logical content would produce at Phase 1 semantic equivalence. A later-phase event MAY add fields under the reserved extension points above, but MUST NOT rename, remove, reorder, or redefine any field of §6.1 in a way that breaks Phase 1 verification. "Strict superset" means semantic and structural preservation through reserved extension containers. It does not mean Phase 1 verifiers accept unknown top-level fields.

### 6.6 Signature scope

An Event signature is the RFC 9052 COSE_Sign1 signature over `EventPayload` using COSE's standard `Sig_structure` preimage:

```text
["Signature1", protected, external_aad, payload]
```

`payload` is the exact dCBOR bytes of `EventPayload`. `external_aad` is the zero-length byte string for Phase 1. The COSE protected header MUST contain `alg`, `kid`, and `suite_id` (§7.4). No signature bytes are present in `EventPayload`, so event signing is non-circular by construction.

### 6.7 Extension Registration

`EventPayload.extensions`, `EventHeader.extensions`, and `CheckpointPayload.extensions` (§11.6) are keyed by text-string identifiers drawn from an IANA-style namespace rooted at the `trellis.` prefix. The registration discipline is:

- Keys starting with `trellis.` are reserved to this specification family and registered by the Trellis Working Group (later: IANA).
- Keys starting with `x-` are vendor / deployment local and MUST NOT be relied on across operators.
- A registered key specifies: the container it lives in (`EventPayload.extensions`, `EventHeader.extensions`, `CheckpointPayload.extensions`, `ExportManifestPayload.extensions`), its CDDL type, the Phase that produces it, and the verification obligation (ignore-if-unknown vs. reject-if-unknown-at-version).
- Registration is append-only; meaning does not change after registration.

Registered extension identifiers:

| Container | Identifier | Phase | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `EventPayload.extensions` | `trellis.custody-model-transition.v1` | 1 | Custody-model Posture-transition record; payload shape per Companion §10 and Appendix A.5.1. Reject-if-unknown-at-version. |
| `EventPayload.extensions` | `trellis.disclosure-profile-transition.v1` | 1 | Posture-transition record for the disclosure-profile axis; payload shape per Companion §10 and Appendix A.5.2. Reject-if-unknown-at-version. |
| `EventPayload.extensions` | `trellis.staff-view-decision-binding.v1` | 1 | Staff-view decision-binding record carrying the §15.2 `Watermark` seen by the adjudicator for a rights-impacting decision; payload shape `StaffViewDecisionBinding`. Reject-if-unknown-at-version. |
| `EventPayload.extensions` | `trellis.evidence-attachment-binding.v1` | 1 | Evidence attachment-binding record from ADR 0072 / Formspec Respondent Ledger §6.9. `PayloadExternal` names the attachment ciphertext bytes; this extension carries the binding metadata. Reject-if-unknown-at-version. |
| `EventPayload.extensions` | `trellis.causal_deps.v2` | 2 | Migrated HLC / DAG causal dependency structure. |
| `EventPayload.extensions` | `trellis.external_anchor.v1` | 2 | Per-event external anchor reference (e.g., OpenTimestamps). |
| `EventHeader.extensions` | `trellis.witness_signature.v1` | 4 | Transparency-witness cosignature slot. |
| `CheckpointPayload.extensions` | `trellis.agency_log.arrival_timestamp.v1` | 3 | Agency-log arrival timestamp at witness-operator ingest. |
| `CheckpointPayload.extensions` | `trellis.agency_log.witness_signature.v1` | 3 | Agency-log per-head witness cosignature. |
| `CheckpointPayload.extensions` | `trellis.case_ledger.composed_response_heads.v1` | 3 | Case-ledger head composition manifest. |
| `CheckpointPayload.extensions` | `trellis.case_ledger.case_scope_metadata.v1` | 3 | Case-scope adjudication metadata. |
| `ExportManifestPayload.extensions` | `trellis.export.attachments.v1` | 1 | Binds optional `061-attachments.cbor` (SHA-256 digest + `inline_attachments` flag). Verifier obligations and manifest entry shape per stack ADR 0072 (evidence integrity and attachment binding). Reject-if-unknown-at-version. |
| `ExportManifestPayload.extensions` | `trellis.export.signature-affirmations.v1` | 1 | Binds optional `062-signature-affirmations.cbor` via `signature_catalog_digest` (SHA-256 of the catalog bytes). Chain-derived catalog over admitted `wos.kernel.signatureAffirmation` events; verifier obligations in §19. Reject-if-unknown-at-version. |
| `ExportManifestPayload.extensions` | `trellis.export.intake-handoffs.v1` | 1 | Binds optional `063-intake-handoffs.cbor` via `intake_catalog_digest` (SHA-256 of the catalog bytes). Chain-derived catalog over admitted `wos.kernel.intakeAccepted` events and optional paired `wos.kernel.caseCreated` events, carrying the Formspec `IntakeHandoff` plus canonical Response bytes needed for offline `responseHash` verification; verifier obligations in §19. Reject-if-unknown-at-version. |

Phase 1 producers MUST emit all `*.extensions` containers as `null` or empty maps, EXCEPT for registered identifiers whose Phase column is `1`, which MAY be emitted by Phase 1 producers and MUST be processed by Phase 1 verifiers per the identifier's reject-if-unknown-at-version obligation. Phase 1 verifiers MUST reject unknown top-level fields (strict-superset semantics) but MUST preserve unknown registered keys inside an `extensions` container. Phase 2+ additions MUST go in a reserved `extensions` container with a registered identifier and MUST NOT be added at the top level of `EventPayload`, `EventHeader`, `CheckpointPayload`, or `ExportManifestPayload`.

### 6.8 Three event surfaces (authored / canonical / signed)

An event exists as three distinct CDDL-level surfaces during its production lifecycle. Each surface has a defined CBOR byte shape, and the three shapes are **not interchangeable**: they differ in which fields are present and in whether the bytes are wrapped in a COSE_Sign1 envelope. Fixture vectors and cross-implementation byte-match tests (§27) refer to these surfaces by name. Traceability: TR-CORE-018.

- **Authored form.** The `AuthorEventHashPreimage` CDDL struct (§9.5). This is the event map an author constructs **before** computing `author_event_hash`: it carries every field that contributes to the author-originated integrity digest but does **not** carry `author_event_hash` itself, and carries no COSE signature material. Its dCBOR serialization is the input to the `trellis-author-event-v1` hash (§9.5). A fixture that pins "the authored bytes" refers to `dCBOR(AuthorEventHashPreimage)`.

- **Canonical form.** The `EventPayload` CDDL struct (§6.1). This is the full event map **including** the computed `author_event_hash`, ready to be signed. It contains no COSE signature bytes — signing is external to the payload. Its dCBOR serialization is the input to the `trellis-event-v1` hash (§9.2) — wrapped in `CanonicalEventHashPreimage` for domain separation — and is the exact payload bytes placed inside the COSE_Sign1 envelope. A fixture that pins "the canonical bytes" refers to `dCBOR(EventPayload)`.

- **Signed form (wire form).** The `Event = COSESign1Bytes` CDDL type (§6.1, §7.4). This is the COSE_Sign1 tag-18 envelope carrying the canonical form as its payload bstr, the Ed25519 signature over the RFC 9052 `Sig_structure`, and the protected-header map pinned by §7.4. This is what appears in `010-events.cbor` (§18.4), in ledger storage, and on the wire. A fixture that pins "the signed bytes" or "the wire bytes" refers to the full COSE_Sign1 tag-18 CBOR encoding.

The three forms have different bytes, different CDDL types, and different roles. An implementor producing test vectors MUST emit each form separately when requested; a verifier decoding a wire event reconstructs the canonical form by extracting the COSE payload, and reconstructs the authored form by projecting the canonical form onto the `AuthorEventHashPreimage` shape (dropping `author_event_hash`). The Phase 1 CDDL grammar does not introduce new type names for these surfaces beyond the three already defined; the names "authored form", "canonical form", and "signed form" are spec-level vocabulary for referring to the existing CDDL types.

---

## 7. Signature Profile

**Requirement class:** Fact Producer, Verifier.

Every signed artifact in Trellis — events, checkpoints, manifests, and signing-key-registry administrative entries — is a COSE_Sign1 value and carries an explicit `suite_id` identifying the signature suite used. A verifier that encounters an unregistered `suite_id` MUST reject the artifact. The `suite_id` registry (§26.2) is part of the IANA considerations.

### 7.1 Pinned Phase 1 suite

**Phase 1 pins `suite_id = 1` to Ed25519-over-COSE_Sign1.** Concretely: the signature is COSE_Sign1 ([RFC 9052]) with `alg = -8` (EdDSA) and the signing key a 32-byte Ed25519 public key ([RFC 8032]). The digest algorithm used by dependent constructions (canonical event hash, content hash, checkpoint tree head) is SHA-256 ([FIPS 180-4]).

A Phase 1 Fact Producer MUST use `suite_id = 1` in the COSE protected header. A Phase 1 Verifier MUST accept any registered `suite_id` whose suite it recognizes, and MUST reject any unregistered `suite_id`.

### 7.2 `suite_id` IANA-style registry

The registry is a content-addressed append-only list; the Phase 1 initial contents are:

| `suite_id` | Signature suite | Digest | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Reserved | — | Reserved | MUST NOT appear on any canonical artifact. |
| 1 | Ed25519 / COSE_Sign1 / EdDSA | SHA-256 | **Active (Phase 1)** | Phase 1 mandatory suite. |
| 2 | Reserved for ML-DSA-65 ([FIPS 204]) | SHA-256 | Reserved | Phase 2+ post-quantum suite candidate. |
| 3 | Reserved for SLH-DSA-128s ([FIPS 205]) | SHA-256 | Reserved | Phase 2+ hash-based signature candidate. |
| 4 | Reserved for hybrid (Ed25519 + ML-DSA-65) | SHA-256 | Reserved | Phase 2+ migration-period hybrid. |
| 5–15 | Reserved | — | Reserved | IANA codepoint reservation, see §26. |

Future suites MUST be registered in the `suite_id` registry before any verifier is required to accept them. A record with an unregistered `suite_id` is not a canonical record.

### 7.3 Migration obligation (multi-decade verifiability)

A verifier running in 2045 MUST be able to resolve a signature produced in 2026 after intervening key rotations, and MUST be able to resolve a signature produced with `suite_id = 1` after the Trellis family has migrated its active default to a post-quantum suite. This imposes three obligations on Phase 1 implementations:

1. Every signed artifact MUST carry its `suite_id` in the COSE protected header (§7.4). A verifier MUST use that `suite_id`, not the "current" suite.
2. Every export MUST include a signing-key registry (§8) capable of resolving the signing `kid` referenced by every event, checkpoint, and manifest in the export, as that key existed at signing time.
3. Crypto parameters (curve, digest, length constraints) MUST be determined by `suite_id`, not by the verifier's current default. A verifier that "upgrades" a 2026 signature to 2045 semantics by reinterpreting it is broken.

Phase 1 does not ship a post-quantum suite. It pins the migration seam and the obligation.

### 7.4 COSE protected headers and Sig_structure

Trellis uses RFC 9052 COSE_Sign1 directly. Implementations MUST use a normal COSE library's signing preimage, not a Trellis-specific self-reference workaround.

**Embedded payload.** Every Trellis COSE_Sign1 artifact is the CBOR tag-18 4-array `[protected, unprotected, payload, signature]` of [RFC 9052] §4.2, with the payload bstr carried at array position 3 (i.e., embedded). Trellis does not use detached payloads: the `payload` field MUST NOT be `nil`, and a verifier MUST reject a COSE_Sign1 whose payload bstr is absent or replaced with `nil`.

For every Trellis COSE_Sign1 artifact, the protected header MUST contain:

| Header | Label (integer key) | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `alg` | `1` (per [RFC 9052] §3.1) | COSE algorithm identifier. Phase 1: `-8` (EdDSA). |
| `kid` | `4` (per [RFC 9052] §3.1) | 16-byte signing-key identifier resolvable in `signing-key-registry.cbor` (§8). |
| `suite_id` | `-65537` | Trellis signature-suite identifier. Phase 1: `1`. |

The protected header MAY additionally carry `artifact_type` under integer label `-65538` with values `"event"`, `"checkpoint"`, `"manifest"`, or another registered value. If present, a verifier MUST check that it matches the containing artifact. If absent, the containing archive member or enclosing structure supplies the artifact type.

**Label rationale and registry.** `alg` and `kid` use the integer labels registered in [RFC 9052] §3.1. The Trellis-specific headers `suite_id` and `artifact_type` use negative integer labels in the COSE private-use range (per [RFC 9052] §1.4 / §11.3), placed below `-65536` to stay clear of the 16-bit-wide IANA-assigned ranges. Future Trellis-introduced protected-header keys MUST be assigned sequentially-descending integer labels from this namespace and registered alongside the `suite_id` registry (§26.2). Implementations MUST NOT use text-string labels for these headers; the integer labels above are the only conformant encoding.

**Protected-header map serialization.** The COSE protected header is itself a CBOR map wrapped in a bstr; its bytes determine the `Sig_structure` preimage and therefore the signature. The protected-header map MUST be serialized per the dCBOR rules of §5.1. Because §5.1 specifies byte-wise lexicographic ordering of the canonical CBOR encoding of each key, CBOR integer keys are effectively ordered by numeric value for single-byte-encoded keys and by their encoded bytes otherwise; duplicate keys MUST be rejected. A verifier MUST recompute `Sig_structure` using the exact protected-header bstr bytes present in the COSE envelope; it MUST NOT re-serialize the map.

To sign an Event, Checkpoint, or Export Manifest:

1. Build the artifact payload map (`EventPayload`, `CheckpointPayload`, or `ExportManifestPayload`) with no signature field.
2. Serialize the payload map as dCBOR (§5).
3. Construct a COSE_Sign1 object whose payload is those bytes.
4. Populate the protected header with `alg`, `kid`, and `suite_id`.
5. Sign the RFC 9052 `Sig_structure` array `["Signature1", protected, external_aad, payload]`, with `external_aad` equal to the zero-length byte string for Phase 1.

A verifier uses the protected-header `kid` to resolve the public key via the signing-key registry (§8), uses protected-header `suite_id` and `alg` to select the suite, and verifies the COSE_Sign1 signature over the standard `Sig_structure`. Signature verification is independent of all other verification steps.

---

## 8. Signing-Key Registry

**Requirement class:** Canonical Append Service (maintains), Export Generator (snapshots), Verifier (resolves).

### 8.1 Why this exists

A COSE signature without a resolvable key is unverifiable after rotation. Phase 1 exports MUST include a signing-key registry snapshot so that verification is self-contained at any future date, including dates after every key the registry references has been rotated out of operational use.

### 8.2 `SigningKeyEntry`

```cddl
SigningKeyEntry = {
  kid:           bstr .size 16,           ; unique key identifier; §8.3
  pubkey:        bstr,                    ; raw public key bytes per suite_id
  suite_id:      uint,                    ; §7.2
  status:        SigningKeyStatus,        ; §8.4
  valid_from:    uint,                    ; RFC 3339 timestamp as Unix seconds UTC
  valid_to:      uint / null,             ; null for currently-active keys
  supersedes:    bstr / null,             ; kid this entry replaces, if any
  attestation:   bstr / null,             ; optional HSM / KMS attestation, suite-defined
}

SigningKeyStatus = &(
  Active:   0,
  Rotating: 1,
  Retired:  2,   ; no new signatures, historical verification permitted
  Revoked:  3,   ; hard-reject events signed under this key after valid_to
)
```

### 8.3 `kid` format

`kid` is a 16-byte opaque identifier. An implementation MAY derive it, or MAY assign it by administrative policy; either MUST produce a `kid` unique within the registry.

**Derived `kid` construction (pinned).** When a `kid` is derived, it MUST be the first 16 bytes of:

```
SHA-256( dCBOR_encode_uint(suite_id_integer) || pubkey_raw )
```

where:

- `dCBOR_encode_uint(x)` is the canonical dCBOR encoding of the unsigned integer `x` per §5.1 (smallest representation; for example, `suite_id = 1` encodes as the single byte `0x01`),
- `pubkey_raw` is the raw public-key bytes for the suite (for Phase 1 `suite_id = 1`, the 32-byte Ed25519 public key per [RFC 8032]),
- `||` denotes byte-string concatenation.

Byte order is fixed: the dCBOR-encoded `suite_id` precedes `pubkey_raw`. Implementations MUST NOT re-order, re-prefix, or re-length-delimit the concatenation; the two byte sequences are concatenated directly.

**Administratively assigned `kid`.** An administrative assignment MAY produce any `bstr` of 1..32 bytes (the `SigningKeyEntry.kid` CDDL is pinned to `bstr .size 16` for Phase 1; administrative assignment within Phase 1 MUST therefore produce exactly 16 bytes). The assignment MUST be consistent with dCBOR-decodability — the `kid` is carried as a `bstr` in the COSE key structure and in the COSE protected header (§7.4). Administrative `kid` values MUST NOT overlap any derived `kid` value already present in the registry; uniqueness within the registry is required regardless of assignment method.

### 8.4 Lifecycle

Legal `status` transitions:

- `Active → Rotating`: a successor key has been provisioned; both keys accept signatures.
- `Rotating → Retired`: successor is fully deployed; the old key accepts no new signatures but remains verifiable for historical material.
- `Rotating → Revoked`: compromise detected during rotation.
- `Active → Revoked`: compromise detected without intermediate Rotating state.
- `Retired → Revoked`: late detection of compromise.

`Revoked` is terminal. `Retired` is terminal for signature issuance but not for verification of historical records. `Destroyed` is out of scope for Phase 1 signing keys (signing-key destruction is an operational action represented in the agency log, §24); the private key material MAY be destroyed, but the `SigningKeyEntry` MUST remain in the registry to preserve historical verifiability.

### 8.5 Registry snapshot in every export

Every export package (§18) MUST include a complete registry snapshot resolvable for every `kid` referenced by any event, checkpoint, or `LedgerServiceWrapEntry` in the export. "Complete" means: for any `kid` cited, the entry for that `kid`, every entry that `supersedes` points to transitively, and every entry that is a supersession ancestor of the cited `kid`. A verifier encountering a `kid` that cannot be resolved against the embedded registry MUST reject the export.

### 8.6 `LedgerServiceWrapEntry` under LAK rotation

A service-side Long-lived Authority Key (LAK) used to wrap payload content-encryption keys (§9.4) MAY rotate independently of event signing keys. Rotation that changes the LAK-wrapping of historical payloads MUST NOT modify any Phase 1 `Event` (including its `key_bag`, `author_event_hash`, or `content_hash`). Instead, a service-side re-wrap produces an append-only `LedgerServiceWrapEntry`:

```cddl
LedgerServiceWrapEntry = {
  ledger_id:          bstr,                ; scope identifier
  author_event_hash:  digest,              ; target event
  lak_version:        uint,                ; new LAK version
  ephemeral_pubkey:   bstr .size 32,       ; X25519 ephemeral public key, unique per wrap (§9.4)
  wrapped_dek:        bstr,                ; HPKE-wrapped DEK, §9.4
  created_at:         uint,                ; Unix seconds UTC
  signature:          COSESign1Bytes,      ; service signature, same COSE suite as §7
}
```

This is load-bearing for invariant #7 (key-bag immutability under rotation). Historical `author_event_hash` values MUST reproduce after any LAK rotation, because no field covered by `author_event_hash` ever changes; the new wrap is a separate canonical artifact.

The `ephemeral_pubkey` freshness and `wrapped_dek` construction obligations for every `LedgerServiceWrapEntry` are normatively pinned in §9.4: each wrap MUST use an X25519 ephemeral keypair unique across every wrap in the containing ledger scope, and the ephemeral private key MUST be destroyed after wrap. The §9.4 obligations apply to rotation-wrap entries identically to initial-wrap entries; this section does not introduce separate semantics.

---

## 9. Hash Construction

**Requirement class:** Fact Producer, Canonical Append Service, Verifier.

### 9.1 Domain separation discipline

Every hash computation in Trellis is domain-separated by a length-prefixed UTF-8 byte tag. The generic form is:

```
digest = SHA-256(
    len(tag)       as 4-byte big-endian unsigned ||
    tag            as UTF-8 bytes ||
    len(component) as 4-byte big-endian unsigned ||
    component      as raw bytes
)
```

Multi-component inputs repeat the `len(component) || component` pair for each input, in the fixed order specified for the construction. Length-prefixing (not delimiter-based framing) removes component-boundary ambiguity. The generic procedure is referenced below by domain tag only. The length-prefix form applies uniformly regardless of component count: a single-component construction (for example, `author_event_hash` over `dCBOR(AuthorEventHashPreimage)`) uses the same `len(tag) || tag || len(component) || component` shape with exactly one `len(component) || component` pair; there is no unprefixed or concatenated variant for the single-component case.

### 9.2 Canonical event hash (`trellis-event-v1`)

The canonical event hash is:

```
canonical_event_hash = SHA-256(
    "trellis-event-v1" domain-separated per §9.1 over
    dCBOR(CanonicalEventHashPreimage)
)
```

```cddl
CanonicalEventHashPreimage = {
  version:       uint .size 1,
  ledger_scope:  bstr,
  event_payload: EventPayload,
}
```

`event_payload` is the decoded `EventPayload` carried as the COSE payload. It contains `author_event_hash`, but it contains no signature bytes. The domain tag `trellis-event-v1` reserves the `-v1` slot for this construction; a future version bump would use `-v2`. Verifiers MUST match the domain tag to the event payload's `version` field.

### 9.3 Content hash (`trellis-content-v1`, over ciphertext)

```
content_hash = SHA-256(
    "trellis-content-v1" domain-separated per §9.1 over
    the exact ciphertext bytes named by payload_ref
)
```

`content_hash` is over **ciphertext**, never plaintext. Hashing plaintext forecloses crypto-shredding: once the DEK is destroyed, plaintext cannot be recovered, so a plaintext hash binds the chain to something that no longer exists — forcing either non-erasure (violating GDPR Article 17 / FOIA redaction obligations) or chain breakage (violating the append-only invariant). Hashing ciphertext preserves both: erasure destroys the DEK, the ciphertext remains hash-verifiable, and the chain stands.

### 9.4 Key bag and HPKE wrap

The payload content-encryption key (DEK) is wrapped for one or more recipients in the event's `key_bag`:

```cddl
KeyBag = {
  entries: [* KeyBagEntry],
}
KeyBagEntry = {
  recipient:        bstr,                ; stable recipient identifier (e.g., "ledger-service", DID)
  suite:            uint,                ; HPKE suite identifier, Phase 1 fixed to 1
  ephemeral_pubkey: bstr .size 32,       ; X25519 ephemeral public key, unique per wrap
  wrapped_dek:      bstr,                ; HPKE-sealed DEK
}
```

Phase 1 HPKE suite 1 ([RFC 9180]) is **Base mode**, KEM = `DHKEM(X25519, HKDF-SHA256)`, KDF = `HKDF-SHA256`, AEAD = `ChaCha20-Poly1305`.

Choice of ChaCha20-Poly1305 over AES-256-GCM for payload AEAD is for constant-time implementability on WASM and non-AES-NI hardware; it is not a security claim about one over the other. Both satisfy the confidentiality requirement. Deployments that require AES-256-GCM MAY register an additional HPKE suite in Phase 2.

For each `KeyBagEntry`, Phase 1 producers call RFC 9180 `SetupBaseS` / `Seal` with `info = h''` and AEAD associated data `aad = h''`. The plaintext input to `Seal` is the 32-byte payload DEK. `KeyBagEntry.ephemeral_pubkey` stores the HPKE encapsulated public key `enc`; `KeyBagEntry.wrapped_dek` stores the AEAD ciphertext-and-tag returned by `Seal`. A future suite registration MAY define a non-empty `info` or `aad`, but suite 1 is pinned to zero-length values so a verifier can reproduce the wrapped-DEK bytes from only the fixture inputs.

Every `KeyBagEntry` (hereafter "wrap") MUST use a fresh X25519 ephemeral keypair, unique across every wrap in the containing ledger scope. For the avoidance of doubt: in an event with N recipients the `key_bag` contains N `KeyBagEntry` rows with N distinct `ephemeral_pubkey` values, generated from N distinct ephemeral private keys; no `ephemeral_pubkey` value produced by any author in any event in the same ledger scope may recur in any later event. The `ephemeral_pubkey` is persisted in the envelope so the recipient can perform ECDH; the corresponding ephemeral private key MUST be used exactly once and destroyed after the wrap is sealed. Reusing an ephemeral private key across wraps, within the same event, across events in the same ledger scope, or across ledger scopes, is a non-conformance.

**Test-vector carve-out.** Language-neutral byte-level test vectors under `fixtures/vectors/**` MAY pin the ephemeral private key as a fixture artifact, because §5.2 and §27 require every fixture to reproduce byte-for-byte across independent implementations and that requirement would otherwise be unsatisfiable for HPKE wraps. A fixture that pins an ephemeral private key MUST: (a) commit the pinned private key under `fixtures/vectors/_keys/` with a filename that names the owning vector, (b) declare in its `manifest.toml` that the pinned key is a test artifact, and (c) state in its `derivation.md` that a production implementation MUST generate the ephemeral in-process and destroy it after single use. The carve-out applies to fixtures only; no production `Fact Producer`, `Canonical Append Service`, or `Verifier` may rely on it.

Authentication note: HPKE Base mode provides no sender authentication at the wrap layer. This is adequate because (a) `author_event_hash` covers the key bag, (b) the event is Ed25519-signed per §7, and (c) any modification to the key bag invalidates the signature. Use of HPKE Auth mode would add sender-key management at the wrap layer without strengthening the envelope; the envelope signature is the authentication boundary.

### 9.5 `author_event_hash` construction

```
author_event_hash = SHA-256(
    "trellis-author-event-v1" domain-separated per §9.1 over
    dCBOR(AuthorEventHashPreimage)
)
```

```cddl
AuthorEventHashPreimage = {
  version:         uint .size 1,
  ledger_scope:    bstr,
  sequence:        uint,
  prev_hash:       digest / null,
  causal_deps:     [* digest] / null,
  content_hash:    digest,
  header:          EventHeader,
  commitments:     [* Commitment] / null,
  payload_ref:     PayloadRef,
  key_bag:         KeyBag,
  idempotency_key: bstr .size (1..64),
  extensions:      { * tstr => any } / null,
}
```

`author_event_hash` binds the envelope payload, payload reference, and key bag at the moment of signing. It excludes itself and all signature material by construction: `AuthorEventHashPreimage` has no `author_event_hash` field and no COSE signature field. It is immutable under rotation because none of its inputs is altered by service-side re-wraps (§8.6); re-wraps produce append-only `LedgerServiceWrapEntry` records outside the author-event scope.

### 9.6 Checkpoint digest (`trellis-checkpoint-v1`)

```
checkpoint_digest = SHA-256(
    "trellis-checkpoint-v1" domain-separated per §9.1 over
    dCBOR(CheckpointHashPreimage)
)
```

```cddl
CheckpointHashPreimage = {
  version:            uint .size 1,
  scope:              bstr,
  checkpoint_payload: CheckpointPayload,
}
```

### 9.7 Export manifest digest (`trellis-export-manifest-v1`)

```
export_manifest_digest = SHA-256(
    "trellis-export-manifest-v1" domain-separated per §9.1 over
    dCBOR(ExportManifestHashPreimage)
)
```

```cddl
ExportManifestHashPreimage = {
  version:          uint .size 1,
  scope:            bstr,
  manifest_payload: ExportManifestPayload,
}
```

The export manifest (§18.3) is also signed as a COSE_Sign1 object. The digest construction above is used when another artifact needs to refer to the manifest by content address.

### 9.8 Domain-tag registry

Phase 1 reserves these domain tags. An implementation MUST NOT use any of these tags for any purpose other than its defined construction. A future version's constructions MUST bump the version suffix and register the new tag.

- `trellis-event-v1` — canonical event hash (§9.2)
- `trellis-author-event-v1` — author event hash (§9.5)
- `trellis-content-v1` — content hash (§9.3)
- `trellis-checkpoint-v1` — checkpoint digest (§11.2)
- `trellis-export-manifest-v1` — export manifest digest (§9.7)
- `trellis-merkle-leaf-v1` — Merkle tree leaf hash (§11.3)
- `trellis-merkle-interior-v1` — Merkle interior-node hash (§11.3)
- `trellis-posture-declaration-v1` — Posture-declaration document digest referenced from custody-model and disclosure-profile Posture-transition events (§6.7 registered extensions; Companion §10)
- `trellis-transition-attestation-v1` — Posture-transition attestation signature preimage `dCBOR([transition_id, effective_at, authority_class])` per Companion A.5 `Attestation` shared rule

---

## 10. Chain Construction

**Requirement class:** Fact Producer (computes prev_hash), Canonical Append Service (enforces order), Verifier (replays chain).

### 10.1 Phase 1: strict linear chain

Phase 1 canonical order is **strict linear** per ledger scope. Events are totally ordered by `sequence`, and each event's `prev_hash` references the canonical event hash of the immediately preceding event. There is exactly one canonical order per ledger scope.

### 10.2 `prev_hash` requirements

- For `sequence == 0`: `prev_hash` MUST be `null`.
- For `sequence == N > 0`: `prev_hash` MUST equal the `canonical_event_hash` (§9.2) of the event with `sequence == N-1` in the same ledger.
- A Canonical Append Service MUST reject any submission whose `prev_hash` does not satisfy this constraint.
- A Verifier MUST verify the chain by recomputing each event's `canonical_event_hash` and checking that it appears as `prev_hash` in the next event.

### 10.3 Reserved: causal dependencies (Phase 2)

Phase 2 MAY upgrade to an HLC-ordered causal DAG. The `causal_deps` field (§6.1) reserves the wire slot. Phase 1 events MUST emit `causal_deps` as `null` or `[]`. Phase 2+ producers populating `causal_deps` emit a new `version` value; Phase 1 verifiers MUST reject events whose `causal_deps` is non-empty at `version == 1`. This reservation exists so that Phase 2 does not require a header-version break.

### 10.4 Ledger scope and partitioning

Canonical order is scoped to a declared **ledger scope** — one Formspec Response for response ledgers, one case for case ledgers, one operator for agency logs, and so on. An implementation MAY partition a logical system into multiple ledgers by scope, but MUST NOT allow competing canonical orders for the same scope. There MUST be exactly one `sequence = 0`, `sequence = 1`, …, per scope.

### 10.5 Append-only invariant

A Canonical Append Service MUST NOT rewrite a canonical event once it has been admitted. "Admitted" means: `canonical_event_hash` is computed, the append attestation is issued, and any subscribed verifier is entitled to expect byte-for-byte reproduction of the event on demand. Correction is always a new event; there is no in-place edit.

### 10.6 Append head artifact

Every successful `append` operation returns a structured **append head** describing the post-append state of the targeted ledger scope. This artifact is the structural companion to the `prev_hash` invariant (§10.2): the next event's `prev_hash` is equal to the previous append's `AppendHead.canonical_event_hash` field, by construction. Traceability: TR-CORE-083.

```cddl
AppendHead = {
  scope:                bstr,            ; ledger scope identifier, equal to the
                                         ; just-appended event's ledger_scope
  sequence:             uint,            ; sequence of the just-appended event
                                         ; (0-indexed, monotonic within scope)
  canonical_event_hash: digest,          ; canonical_event_hash of the just-appended
                                         ; event per §9.2
}
```

An `AppendHead` is serialized as dCBOR (§5.1). Its bytes are fully determined by the just-appended event's canonical form (§6.8); a verifier or a second implementation that recomputes `canonical_event_hash` for the same event and constructs the same `(scope, sequence, canonical_event_hash)` tuple will produce byte-identical `AppendHead` bytes. The artifact carries no signature: it is an integrity-derived return value, not an independent attestation. Append attestation over a range of events is the Checkpoint artifact of §11; `AppendHead` names the single-event post-append state and is the contract between `append` and its caller.

`AppendHead` does not appear in the Phase 1 export package (§18); exports carry the full event sequence plus checkpoints, from which every intermediate `AppendHead` is reproducible. It is a return-value artifact for in-process use, for API responses, and for fixture vectors that pin the expected post-append state.

---

## 11. Checkpoint Format

**Requirement class:** Canonical Append Service (issues), Verifier (validates).

### 11.1 Purpose

A **checkpoint** is a COSE_Sign1 signed tree head over the Merkle tree of canonical event hashes in a ledger scope up to some `tree_size`. The COSE payload is `CheckpointPayload`. Checkpoints enable:

- inclusion proofs (a given event hash appears at a given position),
- consistency proofs (a later tree is an append-only extension of an earlier tree),
- optional external anchoring (Phase 2+ transparency-log witnessing).

### 11.2 `Checkpoint` structure

```cddl
Checkpoint = COSESign1Bytes ; payload is dCBOR(CheckpointPayload)

CheckpointPayload = {
  version:       uint .size 1,          ; = 1 for Phase 1
  scope:         bstr,                  ; ledger scope identifier
  tree_size:     uint,                  ; count of events committed to
  tree_head_hash: digest,               ; Merkle root, §11.3
  timestamp:     uint,                  ; Unix seconds UTC at issuance
  anchor_ref:    bstr / null,           ; §11.5; Phase 1 optional
  prev_checkpoint_hash: digest / null,  ; previous checkpoint's digest, or null for the first
  extensions:    { * tstr => any } / null, ; §11.6; reserved for Phase 3+ heads
}
```

The checkpoint **digest** under domain tag `trellis-checkpoint-v1` is:

```
checkpoint_digest = SHA-256(
    "trellis-checkpoint-v1" domain-separated per §9.1 over
    dCBOR(CheckpointHashPreimage)
)
```

`prev_checkpoint_hash` chains checkpoints so a verifier can validate an ordered sequence without retrieving every event.

### 11.3 Merkle tree construction

The tree is RFC-6962-compatible with domain-separated leaf and interior hashes:

- **Leaf hash:** `SHA-256("trellis-merkle-leaf-v1" domain-separated per §9.1 over canonical_event_hash)`.
- **Interior hash:** `SHA-256("trellis-merkle-interior-v1" domain-separated per §9.1 over (left_hash || right_hash))`.
- **Odd-node promotion:** when a level has an odd number of nodes, the final node is carried up to the next level unchanged (RFC 6962 §2.1 semantics).

The tree is constructed over the sequence `[canonical_event_hash(0), canonical_event_hash(1), ..., canonical_event_hash(tree_size - 1)]` in canonical order.

### 11.4 Inclusion and consistency proofs

An **inclusion proof** for `canonical_event_hash` at position `leaf_index` under a checkpoint with `tree_size = N` is an audit path allowing the verifier to recompute `tree_head_hash` from the leaf. A verifier MUST recompute the root and check bitwise equality with the checkpoint's `tree_head_hash`.

A **consistency proof** between an earlier checkpoint `(m, head_m)` and a later checkpoint `(n, head_n)` where `m < n` is a proof path allowing the verifier to recompute both heads and confirm that the tree at size `n` is an append-only extension of the tree at size `m`.

Both proofs are included in exports (§18.3). A Canonical Append Service that publishes a checkpoint whose consistency proof against any prior head fails is in violation of the append-only invariant (§10.5) and MUST be treated by a verifier as a tampered source.

### 11.5 `anchor_ref` (reserved for Phase 2+ external witnessing)

`anchor_ref` is an optional opaque reference to an external witness or anchor (for example, an OpenTimestamps Bitcoin anchor, a transparency-log cosignature, an RFC 3161 TSA receipt). Phase 1 MUST accept `null`, and MUST NOT require a non-null value. Phase 1 producers MAY emit a value; Phase 1 verifiers MUST NOT fail verification solely on the absence of an anchor. Phase 4 (federation) elevates anchoring to MUST under a separate registered deployment class.

Exports that bundle anchor-proof material (for example, `bitcoin/headers.cbor` bundling Bitcoin block headers) do so under a Phase 2+ registered deployment class; Phase 1 verification MUST NOT depend on such material.

### 11.6 Head-format extension container

`CheckpointPayload.extensions` is the only Phase 1 reservation for Phase 3 case-ledger head data. Phase 1 emission and rejection rules for this container are governed by §6.7 (authoritative); in summary, Phase 1 producers MUST emit `extensions` as `null` or an empty map, and Phase 1 verifiers MUST reject unknown top-level fields in `CheckpointPayload` while preserving and ignoring unknown registered keys inside `extensions`.

Phase 3 case-ledger heads MUST embed or preserve the Phase 1 checkpoint payload unchanged. Additional head data is carried only in `extensions`, for example:

```cddl
CaseLedgerHeadExtensions = {
  ? composed_response_heads: [* digest],
  ? case_scope_metadata: CaseScope,
  ? witness_signatures: [* WitnessSignature],
}
```

The extension container is load-bearing for invariant #12: agency-log adoption is not a wire-format break for any Phase 1 checkpoint already in the field.

### 11.7 Interop sidecar derivation (non-normative)

The `CheckpointPayload` fields — `scope`, `tree_size`, `tree_head_hash`, `timestamp`, and the RFC-6962-compatible Merkle construction of §11.3–§11.4 — are intentionally shape-equivalent to a SCITT-style signed-log-statement-plus-inclusion-proof. A conforming implementation MAY emit a SCITT-receipt interop sidecar as a deterministic derivation of a checkpoint plus a target event hash; the normative discipline, registry, and Phase-1 reservation-with-lockoff rules live in [ADR 0008 — Interop Sidecar Discipline](../thoughts/adr/0008-interop-sidecar-discipline.md). Phase-1 verification is unaffected: core checkpoint verification MUST NOT depend on any interop sidecar.

---

## 12. Header Policy

**Requirement class:** Fact Producer, Canonical Append Service, Verifier.

The event header is where Trellis makes an explicit, normatively-enumerated trade-off between what is plaintext (available for routing, classification, retention) and what is a commitment to an encrypted or private value. Implementations MUST NOT move fields across this boundary without a `version` bump.

### 12.1 `EventHeader` shape

```cddl
EventHeader = {
  event_type:    bstr,                    ; registered event-type identifier (§14)
  authored_at:   uint,                    ; Unix seconds UTC; plaintext
  retention_tier: uint .size 1,           ; 0..3; plaintext
  classification: bstr,                   ; registered classification identifier; plaintext
  outcome_commitment: digest / null,      ; §12.2; commitment, NOT plaintext outcome
  subject_ref_commitment: digest / null,  ; §12.2; commitment, NOT plaintext subject
  tag_commitment: digest / null,          ; §12.2; commitment, NOT plaintext tags
  witness_ref:   bstr / null,             ; reserved for Phase 4
  extensions:    { * tstr => any } / null, ; additive; §12.3
}
```

`event_type` and `classification` resolve against the bound registry snapshot per §14.4. The reserved test prefix `x-trellis-test/` (§14.6) exempts conformance-fixture identifiers from live registry lookup; production deployments MUST NOT admit events whose `event_type` or `classification` bear that prefix.

### 12.2 Plaintext vs. committed declaration table

The following declaration is normative. Phase 1 events MUST place each field in the named layer; Phase 1 verifiers MUST reject an event whose header places a field in the wrong layer.

| Field | Layer | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `event_type` | Plaintext header | Structural verification, registry lookup (§14). MUST be outcome-neutral (see §12.4). |
| `authored_at` | Plaintext header | Routing, retention computation, audit timelines. MAY be coarsened per Operational Companion. |
| `retention_tier` | Plaintext header | Required for retention enforcement without decryption. |
| `classification` | Plaintext header | Required for routing and access-decision prefiltering. MUST NOT reveal outcome. |
| `outcome_commitment` | Commitment (plaintext is in ciphertext payload) | Determinations (granted / denied / eligible / ineligible) are HIPAA / adjudication sensitive; outcome in plaintext is a metadata disclosure. Commitment allows verifiers with payload access to check; observers learn nothing. |
| `subject_ref_commitment` | Commitment | Subject identity is sensitive in most jurisdictions. Plaintext subject in the header enables passive re-identification via envelope metadata alone. |
| `tag_commitment` | Commitment | Tags like `adverse-decision`, `appeal-pending` leak outcome indirectly. |
| `witness_ref` | Plaintext header (when present) | Phase 4 external witness references are structural. |
| `extensions` | Plaintext additive | Additive header fields (§12.3); MUST NOT carry outcome or subject material. |

The commitment construction for each `*_commitment` field is:

```
commitment = SHA-256(
    "trellis-header-commitment-v1" domain-separated per §9.1 over
    dCBOR([committed_value, commitment_nonce])
)
```

where `commitment_nonce` is a fresh 16-byte random value stored inside the encrypted payload (never in the envelope). Without the nonce, low-entropy committed values (for example, boolean eligibility) are trivially recoverable by hash-candidate brute force; the nonce makes the commitment hiding against external observers while remaining verifiable by payload holders.

### 12.3 `extensions` sub-map

`EventHeader.extensions` is a map from text-string keys to arbitrary CBOR values governed by the same registration discipline as every other `*.extensions` container: see §6.7. Keys beginning with `trellis.` are reserved to this specification family; keys beginning with `x-` are vendor / deployment local. Unknown registered keys MUST be preserved by intermediaries (round-tripped) and MAY be ignored by verifiers. `extensions` MUST NOT be used to smuggle fields that belong in the committed layer (outcome, subject, sensitive tags); doing so is a trust-posture-honesty violation (§20).

### 12.4 Event-type granularity

Registered `event_type` values MUST be outcome-neutral. Concretely: `wos.determination` is registered; `wos.determination.adverse` and `wos.determination.favorable` MUST NOT be. Outcome is carried in `outcome_commitment` and the encrypted payload. Event types within the same classification SHOULD be indistinguishable by commitment count or envelope shape so that the fixed plaintext fields do not leak outcome signal.

---

## 13. Commitment Slots Reserved

**Requirement class:** Fact Producer, Verifier.

Phase 1 reserves wire-level slots for per-field cryptographic commitments that enable redaction-aware export and selective disclosure in Phase 2+. The implementation of selective disclosure (BBS+, Pedersen with range proofs, Merkle-leaf revelation) is deferred. The slots are normative now because retrofitting them requires a wire-format break, and because Phase 3 portable case files without selective disclosure force either all-or-nothing disclosure or envelope reissue.

### 13.1 `Commitment` structure

```cddl
Commitment = {
  scheme:        uint,                ; commitment scheme identifier, §13.3
  slot:          uint,                ; position in fixed-per-event-type vector
  value:         bstr,                ; scheme-defined commitment bytes
  metadata:      bstr / null,         ; scheme-defined auxiliary data
}
```

### 13.2 Fixed-position vectors

For each registered `event_type`, the event-type registry (§14) MAY declare a fixed number of commitment slots and their intended field associations. Every event of a given type MUST carry exactly that number of commitments. Unused slots MUST be filled with a scheme-defined identity value (for example, a commitment to zero with random blinding for Pedersen; an all-zeros digest for Merkle) that is indistinguishable from populated slots.

### 13.3 Scheme registry (initial)

| `scheme` | Meaning | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Reserved | Reserved |
| 1 | Merkle leaf over dCBOR-serialized field value with salt | Reserved (Phase 2+) |
| 2 | Pedersen commitment over Ristretto255 | Reserved (Phase 2+) |
| 3 | BBS+ attribute commitment | Reserved (Phase 2+) |

Phase 1 producers MUST emit `commitments` as `null` or `[]`. Phase 1 verifiers MUST accept either. Phase 2+ implementations fill the slots under the registered scheme, and Phase 2+ verifiers accept according to the registry.

### 13.4 Why slots, not implementation, in Phase 1

Fixing the scheme in Phase 1 would lock in a scheme that the selective-disclosure field is still standardizing (BBS+ draft cadence, post-quantum disclosure schemes). Fixing the slot reservation now costs nothing; fixing the scheme now risks an obsolete choice. Slot reservation makes Phase 2 additive; not reserving would make Phase 2 a break.

---

## 14. Registry Snapshot Binding

**Requirement class:** Export Generator (embeds), Verifier (resolves historical meaning).

### 14.1 The problem

Signature verification without registry binding proves **byte integrity only** — it proves the signed bytes are unmodified, but it does not prove what those bytes **meant** at signing time. A 2045 verifier looking at a 2026 event needs to know: what did `event_type = "wos.determination"` signify in 2026? What was the commitment schema for that type? What classification vocabulary was in force?

Resolving those questions against a live registry in 2045 is insufficient, because the registry may have evolved, been migrated, or ceased to exist. Resolving against the registry **snapshot** that was in force at signing time is what preserves semantic verifiability.

### 14.2 Bound registry

Every export package (§18) MUST embed the domain registry in force at signing time, content-addressed by its SHA-256 digest. The registry covers at minimum:

- event-type taxonomy: `event_type` → semantic name, commitment schema, privacy classification,
- role vocabulary: actor roles admissible under the bound WOS and Formspec versions,
- governance rules: the WOS governance ruleset identifier and its digest,
- classification vocabulary: allowed values of `header.classification`.

### 14.3 `RegistryBinding`

```cddl
RegistryBinding = {
  registry_digest: digest,             ; SHA-256 over canonical registry bytes
  registry_format: uint,               ; 1 = dCBOR; 2+ reserved
  registry_version: tstr,              ; human-readable version string
  bound_at_sequence: uint,             ; sequence in the ledger where binding took effect
}
```

An export manifest MUST contain one or more `RegistryBinding` entries. The first binding MUST cover `sequence = 0`. Subsequent bindings, if any, MUST appear in monotonic `bound_at_sequence` order and each MUST be preceded by an explicit binding event in the canonical order.

### 14.4 Verifier obligation

A verifier resolving `event_type` (or any other registry-bound field) for an event at sequence `S` MUST resolve against the binding whose `bound_at_sequence` is the largest value `≤ S`, using the embedded registry bytes, not a live lookup. A verifier that performs a live registry lookup to interpret a historical event is non-conformant.

### 14.5 Registry migration discipline

Registry changes that affect interpretation (event-type semantics, commitment layout, privacy tier) MUST emit a new `RegistryBinding` fact in the canonical ledger before events using the new interpretation are admitted. This is the same rule that governs `construction_id` migration in the prior binding draft, applied to the registry-snapshot layer here.

### 14.6 Reserved test identifiers

The text-string prefix `x-trellis-test/` is reserved across every registry-bound identifier namespace (`event_type`, `classification`, and any future Phase 1 registry-bound string field in `EventHeader`). Identifiers bearing this prefix are reserved for use by conformance fixtures (§27) and interoperability test vectors; they are not resolvable against any deployed registry binding and are not governed by §14.4's verifier-obligation to resolve against a `RegistryBinding`. Traceability: TR-CORE-073.

A fixture vector MAY use any identifier matching the pattern `x-trellis-test/<slug>` (for example, `x-trellis-test/append-minimal` as an `event_type`, or `x-trellis-test/unclassified` as a `classification`) without pinning a corresponding entry in an external registry. A verifier processing a test vector MUST accept `x-trellis-test/*` identifiers in the bound registry without live-resolution, provided the embedded registry snapshot declares them.

Production deployments MUST NOT accept events bearing `x-trellis-test/*` identifiers. A Canonical Append Service operating under a non-test deployment binding MUST reject any submission whose `event_type` or `classification` begins with `x-trellis-test/`. The `x-` prefix family remains reserved for vendor / deployment-local identifiers per §6.7; the `x-trellis-test/` sub-prefix is specifically reserved within that family for Trellis Working Group conformance fixtures.

---

## 15. Snapshot and Watermark Discipline

**Requirement class:** Derived Processor, Export Generator.

### 15.1 Core rule

Every derived artifact and every agency-log entry MUST carry a **watermark** `(tree_size, tree_head_hash)` identifying the canonical state from which it was derived, plus a deterministic **rebuild path** from the canonical chain to the derived artifact. Full-replay from `sequence = 0` is not a valid Phase 1 implementation for any system holding more than trivial quantities of case data — at case-file scale, full replay is operationally infeasible, and retrofitting snapshots invalidates every derived view already shipped.

This section owns the **core rule** (watermark + rebuild-path requirement). The **operational elaboration** — snapshot cadence, purge cascade after crypto-shredding, staleness handling, index rebuild guarantees — belongs to the Operational Companion. The core rule belongs here because the watermark is part of the canonical export and the rebuild path is part of the verification contract.

### 15.2 `Watermark`

```cddl
Watermark = {
  scope:                bstr,
  tree_size:            uint,
  tree_head_hash:       digest,
  checkpoint_ref:       digest,              ; checkpoint_digest (§11.2)
  built_at:             uint,                ; Unix seconds UTC when the artifact was built
  rebuild_path:         tstr,                ; implementation-defined deterministic identifier
  ? projection_schema_id: tstr,              ; optional; projection schema version identifier
                                             ; (URI per RFC 3986 when present)
}
```

A derived artifact's `Watermark` MUST be verifiable against the canonical chain: the named `checkpoint_ref` MUST exist in the export (or be resolvable against a referenced checkpoint chain), and the chain of events up to `tree_size` under that checkpoint's `tree_head_hash` MUST verify.

The `projection_schema_id` field is REQUIRED whenever the bearer is a projection governed by Companion §14.1 (it identifies the projection schema version under which the derived artifact was built) and MUST be OMITTED for non-projection derivatives (for example, agency-log entries per §15.4). When present it MUST be a URI conforming to RFC 3986 (the `tstr` in the CDDL is a syntactic relaxation; the normative type is URI, matching Companion Appendix B.5).

### 15.3 Rebuild path

`rebuild_path` is a deterministic identifier that, combined with the canonical events up to `tree_size` and with the declared configuration history of the derived processor, allows a recipient to rebuild the derived artifact and confirm byte-for-byte equivalence. The rebuild path is not a guarantee of performance; it is a guarantee that the derived artifact is not authoritative and can be regenerated.

**Rebuild-output encoding.** Rebuilt derived artifacts MUST use dCBOR (§5) as their canonical encoding whenever the artifact shape admits CBOR serialization. Two conforming implementations that rebuild the same derived artifact from the same canonical events and configuration history MUST produce byte-equal output. Fields whose determinism depends on external state (wall-clock timestamps, per-implementation resource IDs) MUST be declared in the rebuild-path identifier as non-deterministic; byte-equality is required over the declared-deterministic portion only (Companion §15.3 OC-40).

**Phase 1 export scope.** Phase 1 exports (§18) do NOT carry Companion projection artifacts such as `Watermark` records; those are runtime state, not Phase 1 export members. Phase 1 exports MAY carry **chain-derived** catalog bytes that are fully determined by the signed event sequence and registered manifest extensions — for example the optional `061-attachments.cbor` attachment manifest bound under `ExportManifestPayload.extensions` per `trellis.export.attachments.v1` (stack ADR 0072; §18.2, §19), the optional `062-signature-affirmations.cbor` signature-affirmation catalog bound under `trellis.export.signature-affirmations.v1` (WOS Signature Profile / stack WOS-T4 closeout; §18.2, §19), and the optional `063-intake-handoffs.cbor` intake-handoff catalog bound under `trellis.export.intake-handoffs.v1` (stack ADR 0073; §18.2, §19). Such members MUST NOT introduce new authority beyond what the signed chain already attests. The intake-handoff catalog is permitted because it carries the exact Formspec handoff and canonical Response bytes needed to replay `responseHash` offline; it does not redefine the WOS decision records. If watermarks are later added to exports (Phase 2+), they MUST be carried inside `ExportManifestPayload.extensions` under a registered identifier (e.g., `trellis.watermarks.v1`), never as a new top-level manifest field.

### 15.4 Rule applies to agency-log entries

Phase 3 agency-log entries (§24) are themselves derived artifacts in the sense that they compose case-ledger heads with arrival metadata. They MUST carry a watermark. An agency log that cannot be rebuilt from the canonical underlying case ledgers is non-conformant — regardless of how well its own internal integrity is preserved.

---

## 16. Verification Independence Contract

**Requirement class:** Verifier, Export Generator.

### 16.1 Normative requirement

Export verification MUST NOT depend on:

- derived artifacts (projections, evaluator state, caches, indexes, timelines),
- workflow runtime state (task queues, orchestration state, session state),
- mutable service databases,
- live access to the producing service's APIs, beyond what the export package explicitly names as optional external proof material.

The verifier MUST be able to complete every obligation in §19 on an air-gapped laptop, given only the export ZIP and whatever optional external proof material (for example, a Bitcoin header bundle for OpenTimestamps anchor verification) the package names.

### 16.2 No live registry lookups

A Phase 1 verifier MUST NOT perform a live registry lookup to interpret an event. Registry meaning is bound per §14 at signing time and embedded in the export per §18.

### 16.3 Optional external anchors

A package MAY reference external anchoring (transparency log URL, Bitcoin block anchor, RFC 3161 TSA receipt). Such references MUST be marked explicitly as optional external proof material in the manifest and MUST NOT be required for baseline Phase 1 verification. A Phase 1 verifier that the package's signed tree head and consistency-proof material verify MUST return "verified" even if the external anchor cannot be fetched. Phase 4 deployments MAY register a deployment class that elevates external anchoring to required; absent such a class, anchoring is additive.

### 16.4 Omitted-payload honesty

If a package omits ciphertext bytes or payload readability material (because payloads are reader-held and the verifier is not a reader, or because payloads are intentionally redacted), the package MUST still verify the structure, signatures, provenance, and append claims that are verifiable from included bytes. The verification algorithm (§19) returns `structure_verified`, `integrity_verified`, and `readability_verified` separately, plus a list of omitted payload checks. A package that silently fails — that omits both material and the declaration of omission — is non-conformant.

---

## 17. Append Idempotency Contract

**Requirement class:** Fact Producer, Canonical Append Service, Verifier.

### 17.1 Why this is wire contract, not operator convention

Every `append` call carries a stable `idempotency_key`. Without a wire-contract idempotency semantic, every operator implements dedup locally, implementations diverge exactly at the boundary where they matter (network retry at submission), and interop between a primary and a second implementation is blocked. Idempotency at the envelope layer is the only construction that survives multiple operators composing one agency log.

### 17.2 `idempotency_key`

`idempotency_key` is a byte string of 1–64 bytes. It MAY be a UUIDv7 ([RFC 9562]), a stable caller-assigned identifier, or any value chosen by the Fact Producer so long as the producer guarantees that equivalent authored submissions produce equal keys.

The recommended convention is UUIDv7, because:

- it is globally unique without coordination,
- it encodes wall-time in the first bytes (useful for archival debugging),
- RFC 9562 pins its format, avoiding legacy UUIDv4 randomness variance.

Callers may substitute a deterministic hash of the authored fact's causal identity (for example, `SHA-256(session_id || field_path || proposed_value)`) if that better matches their retry semantics.

### 17.3 Resolution semantics

An idempotency identity is the pair `(ledger_scope, idempotency_key)`. **The identity is permanent within that ledger scope.** For a given `ledger_scope`, a specific `idempotency_key` value identifies exactly one canonical event forever; key reuse within the same ledger scope after any TTL expiry is forbidden. A Canonical Append Service MUST NOT reuse the same idempotency identity for a different authored payload after a clock interval, API TTL, dedup-store compaction, or operator lifecycle event. Retry budgets, API TTLs, and dedup-store lifecycle are operational policy and are explicitly deferred to the Trellis Operational Companion §18 (Append Idempotency (Operational)); those operator-layer concerns do not relax this Core identity rule.

For a given `idempotency_key` within a declared ledger scope, a Canonical Append Service MUST resolve every successful retry to exactly one of:

1. **Same canonical reference.** The exact canonical event hash that was admitted on the first successful submission. The service returns the same `canonical_event_hash`, and the payload `content_hash` is byte-equal to the original.
2. **Declared no-op.** A successful retry against a key that was admitted but whose subsequent retry carries a payload that is byte-identical (post-dCBOR canonicalization) returns a structured no-op response referencing the original canonical event hash.
3. **Reject on conflict.** A retry that shares `idempotency_key` but whose payload would produce a different `content_hash`, `author_event_hash`, or `canonical_event_hash` MUST be rejected with the structured error `IdempotencyKeyPayloadMismatch` (§17.5). This is invariant #13 of the vision document, lifted to normative text: same key, different payload means deterministic rejection, auditable.

The service MUST NOT, on retry, create a new canonical order position with a different canonical event hash under the same `idempotency_key`. Duplication at the same `idempotency_key` with a different hash is undefined canonical order.

### 17.4 Operational retry policy boundary

Core defines the permanent, scope-permanent idempotency identity and deterministic replay/rejection semantics. The Operational Companion §18 (Append Idempotency (Operational)) defines retry budgets, API-facing TTLs, dedup-store retention lifecycle, and how operators document storage compaction. No operational policy may cause `(ledger_scope, idempotency_key)` to accept a different payload after any expiry; operator policy may only decide how long the *accept-or-reject decision* stays fast (before falling back to a replay-from-chain lookup), never what the decision is.

### 17.5 Rejection codes

The following rejection codes are normative for Phase 1. Each is a structured, verifiable response, not a free-form error string.

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `IdempotencyKeyPayloadMismatch` | Same `(ledger_scope, idempotency_key)`, different payload/hash material — see §17.3. |
| `prev_hash_mismatch` | `prev_hash` does not match the predecessor's canonical event hash (§10.2). |
| `sequence_gap` | `sequence` is not `prev.sequence + 1`. |
| `unknown_suite_id` | `suite_id` is not registered (§7.2). |
| `unresolvable_kid` | COSE protected-header `kid` cannot be resolved in the active registry (§8.5). |
| `registry_digest_mismatch` | Event's bound registry does not match export manifest (§14). |
| `hash_construction_mismatch` | Event uses a hash construction not registered. |
| `missing_required_field` | Envelope is missing a required field. |
| `header_layer_violation` | A field appears in the wrong layer per §12.2. |
| `chain_break` | General category for chain-integrity failures at verification time. |

Additional codes MAY be registered in Phase 2+.

---

## 18. Export Package Layout

**Requirement class:** Export Generator (produces), Verifier (consumes).

### 18.1 Deterministic ZIP

An export package is a deterministic ZIP archive. "Deterministic" means:

- entries ordered in byte-wise lexicographic order of their UTF-8 filename — this single lexicographic order IS the required processing order; there is no separate "manifest first" rule because the `000-` prefix on the manifest filename already places it first lexicographically,
- entry names are prefixed (`000-`, `010-`, `020-`, `030-`, `040-`, `050-`, `060-`, `090-`, `098-`, `099-`) so that lexicographic ordering produces the required processing order deterministically,
- compression method is **`STORED` (ZIP method 0) only** for every entry; DEFLATE is forbidden because DEFLATE output is not deterministic across libraries without fully pinning every DEFLATE parameter, and this specification refuses to open that door,
- local file headers have extra-field length zero,
- file modification time is fixed to `1980-01-01T00:00:00Z` in DOS time (the ZIP epoch minimum),
- external file attributes are zero,
- the ZIP central-directory entries are written in the same order as local-file entries (i.e., lexicographic by filename),
- no ZIP64 unless the package exceeds 4 GiB or an entry exceeds 4 GiB.

The archive name SHOULD follow the pattern `trellis-export-<scope>-<tree_size>-<short_head_hash>.zip`.

A conforming implementation can reproduce the archive layout with a `zip -X -0` style invocation over files already named with the prefixes below, provided it suppresses extra fields and normalizes timestamps and attributes as required above. Example recipe (schematic; shell-level determinism still requires suppressing the zip tool's default extended-timestamp and UID/GID attributes):

```sh
# Build a deterministic Trellis export ZIP (Fix-4 recipe)
# -X     strip extra file attributes (UID/GID, extended timestamps)
# -0     compression method STORED only
# Files already carry the 000-/010-/... prefixes so lexicographic order
# equals required processing order.

### 18.3 `ExportManifest`

```cddl
SignedExportManifest = COSESign1Bytes ; payload is dCBOR(ExportManifestPayload)

ExportManifestPayload = {
  format:           tstr,                 ; "trellis-export/1"
  version:          uint .size 1,         ; = 1 for Phase 1
  generator:        tstr,                 ; generator identifier
  generated_at:     uint,                 ; Unix seconds UTC
  scope:            bstr,                 ; ledger scope
  tree_size:        uint,                 ; events covered
  head_checkpoint_digest: digest,         ; §11.2
  registry_bindings: [+ RegistryBinding], ; §14
  signing_key_registry_digest: digest,    ; SHA-256 of 030-signing-key-registry.cbor

  checkpoints_digest: digest,             ; SHA-256 of 040-checkpoints.cbor
  inclusion_proofs_digest: digest,        ; SHA-256 of inclusion-proofs.cbor
  consistency_proofs_digest: digest,      ; SHA-256 of consistency-proofs.cbor
  payloads_inlined: bool,                 ; true if 060-payloads/ is present
  external_anchors: [* ExternalAnchor],   ; §16.3; optional (see Appendix A §28 for ExternalAnchor)
  posture_declaration: PostureDeclaration, ; §20
  head_format_version: uint,              ; §18.7; Phase 1 = 1
  omitted_payload_checks: [* OmittedPayloadCheck], ; §16.4, §19
  extensions:       { * tstr => any } / null,
}
```

The manifest binds every other archive member by digest. A verifier MUST check that every digest in the manifest matches the actual archive contents.

```cddl
OmittedPayloadCheck = {
  content_hash: digest,
  reason:       tstr,
}
```

### 18.4 `010-events.cbor`

A dCBOR array of `Event` COSE_Sign1 records in canonical order, starting at `sequence = 0` up to `sequence = tree_size - 1`. Concatenation and ordering are canonical; byte-match reproducibility is mandatory.

### 18.5 `inclusion-proofs.cbor` and `consistency-proofs.cbor`

- **Inclusion proofs.** A dCBOR map from `leaf_index` (uint) to `InclusionProof` under the final head. Every event in the export MUST have an inclusion proof.
- **Consistency proofs.** A dCBOR array of `ConsistencyProof` records linking each intermediate checkpoint to the next, plus a proof from the first checkpoint's head to the final head. This enables a verifier to confirm append-only growth without storing every intermediate tree.

```cddl
InclusionProof = {
  leaf_index:  uint,
  tree_size:   uint,
  leaf_hash:   digest,
  audit_path:  [* digest],
}
ConsistencyProof = {
  from_tree_size: uint,
  to_tree_size:   uint,
  proof_path:     [* digest],
}
```

### 18.6 `040-checkpoints.cbor`

A dCBOR array of all `Checkpoint` COSE_Sign1 records issued for this scope up to and including the final checkpoint of the export. Checkpoints are ordered by `tree_size` ascending. Each checkpoint payload's `prev_checkpoint_hash` MUST match the previous checkpoint's digest.

### 18.7 Head format version and superset commitment

The `head_format_version` field identifies the checkpoint / head format. Phase 1 ships version 1. Phase 3 case-ledger heads are a strict superset at a later version number: they preserve the Phase 1 `CheckpointPayload` fields unchanged and carry additional fields only in `CheckpointPayload.extensions` (§11.6). A Phase 1 verifier reading a later head format under a Phase-1-declared scope MAY return `unknown_head_format`, but it MUST NOT accept unknown top-level checkpoint fields as though they were Phase 1.

**Relationship to `CheckpointPayload.version`.** `ExportManifestPayload.head_format_version` (§18.3) and `CheckpointPayload.version` (§11.2) are distinct fields with distinct meanings. `head_format_version` names the envelope profile a verifier should apply to the head composition; `CheckpointPayload.version` is the version of the Checkpoint structure itself. In Phase 1 both values are `1`. Phase 3 will bump `head_format_version` to `2` (case-ledger head composition), while `CheckpointPayload.version` MAY remain `1` because the Checkpoint structure itself is a strict superset, not a redefinition — Phase 3 additions go in `CheckpointPayload.extensions`. A verifier MUST select its Phase behavior from `head_format_version`, not from `CheckpointPayload.version`.

This is invariant #12 lifted normatively: **agency-log adoption is not a wire-format break for any Phase 1 export already in the field.**

### 18.8 `verify.sh`

`090-verify.sh` is a POSIX shell script that invokes the verifier binary appropriate for the current platform (detected via `uname`) and exits with `0` on verification success. The script MUST NOT require network access. Its full source SHOULD be at most a few dozen lines; its authority is the verifier binary, not the script.

### 18.9 `README.md`

`098-README.md` is a human-readable orientation file. Normative only in that it MUST state: the scope, the `tree_size`, the final `tree_head_hash`, the posture declaration (§20), which payload checks were omitted offline, and the verification invocation. It SHOULD NOT describe the export as legally admissible (§20.4).

---

## 19. Verification Algorithm

**Requirement class:** Verifier.

Given an export ZIP `E`, a verifier MUST implement the following algorithm. All steps MUST run without network access. Time and memory bounds: linear in the number of events for structure and integrity, O(log N) per inclusion proof, O(log N) per consistency proof. The output separates structure, ciphertext integrity, and payload readability because exports may intentionally omit ciphertext bytes or decryption material.

**Failure classes (normative).** The algorithm distinguishes two classes of failure:

- **Fatal failures.** The verifier MUST abort immediately and return a report with `structure_verified = false`. Fatal failures are: invalid manifest structure, manifest signature invalid, archive-member digest mismatch against the manifest, signing-key-registry resolution failure for any manifest or checkpoint `kid`, and checkpoint signature invalid.
- **Localizable failures.** The verifier MUST continue, accumulate the failure in the report's per-artifact failure list, and report on a per-event or per-proof basis. Localizable failures are: individual event hash mismatches, individual event signature failures, individual payload integrity failures (including ciphertext-hash mismatches), individual inclusion-proof failures, and individual consistency-proof failures between non-head checkpoints.

The intent is that a single tampered event does not hide other tampering: localizable failures are enumerated, not short-circuited.

```text
VERIFY(E) -> VerificationReport

1. Open E as a deterministic ZIP (§18.1). If the ZIP layout is non-deterministic,
   abort with report.layout_error.

2. Read 000-manifest.cbor as SignedExportManifest. Verify its COSE_Sign1:
     a. Resolve protected-header kid via embedded 030-signing-key-registry.cbor.
        If unresolvable, abort with report.unresolvable_manifest_kid.
     b. Verify protected-header alg and suite_id are registered and consistent.
     c. Verify the RFC 9052 Sig_structure signature over the manifest payload.
        If invalid,
        abort with report.manifest_signature_invalid.
     d. Decode the COSE payload as ExportManifestPayload; reject unknown top-level fields.

3. Verify digests bound by the manifest:
     a. SHA-256(010-events.cbor) == manifest.events_digest
     b. SHA-256(040-checkpoints.cbor) == manifest.checkpoints_digest
     c. SHA-256(020-inclusion-proofs.cbor) == manifest.inclusion_proofs_digest
     d. SHA-256(025-consistency-proofs.cbor) == manifest.consistency_proofs_digest
     e. SHA-256(030-signing-key-registry.cbor) == manifest.signing_key_registry_digest
     f. For each RegistryBinding rb in manifest.registry_bindings:
          SHA-256(050-registries/<rb.registry_digest>.cbor) == rb.registry_digest
   Any mismatch ⇒ abort with report.archive_integrity_failure.

4. For each Event COSE_Sign1 e in 010-events.cbor (in order):
     a. Resolve protected-header kid via 030-signing-key-registry.cbor.
        Check the resolved `SigningKeyEntry` lifecycle against
        `payload.header.authored_at`:
          - If `status = Revoked` and `valid_to != null` and
            `payload.header.authored_at > valid_to`, record
            `revoked_authority` in `report.event_failures` for that event
            and continue.
          - If `status = Revoked` and `valid_to = null`, treat the registry
            entry as malformed and reject the export.
        `Retired` is historical-verification-permitted (§8.4) and does not
        itself fail verification of historical events.
     b. Verify protected-header alg and suite_id, then verify the COSE Sig_structure (§7.4).
     c. Decode the COSE payload as EventPayload; reject unknown top-level fields.
     d. Recompute author_event_hash(payload) per §9.5. Check equals payload.author_event_hash.
     e. Recompute canonical_event_hash(payload) per §9.2.
     f. Check payload.ledger_scope == manifest.scope.
     g. If payload.payload_ref is PayloadInline:
          check SHA-256(payload_ref.ciphertext) under §9.3 == payload.content_hash.
        If payload.payload_ref is PayloadExternal and 060-payloads/<content_hash>.bin exists:
          check SHA-256(file bytes) under §9.3 == payload.content_hash.
        If payload.payload_ref is PayloadExternal and bytes are absent:
          record report.omitted_payload_checks[payload.content_hash] and continue
          with the remaining structure and chain checks for this event.
     h. If payload.sequence == 0: check payload.prev_hash == null. Else check
        payload.prev_hash == canonical_event_hash(events[payload.sequence - 1]).
     i. Check payload.causal_deps is null or [] (Phase 1 strict-linear, §10.3).
     j. Resolve the RegistryBinding applicable to payload.sequence per §14.4;
        check payload.header.event_type and related fields against the bound registry.
     k. If the bound registry or WOS semantics identify payload.header.event_type
        as a rights-impacting decision event, EventPayload.extensions MUST carry
        `trellis.staff-view-decision-binding.v1`; absence is a structure failure
        for that event and MUST be recorded in report.event_failures. When
        EventPayload.extensions carries `trellis.staff-view-decision-binding.v1`,
        decode the extension payload as `StaffViewDecisionBinding` (§6.7,
        Appendix A). Check that its `watermark` validates against the §15.2
        `Watermark` shape, including `projection_schema_id` because staff views
        are projections, and that `stale_acknowledged` is a boolean. Malformed
        binding payloads are structure failures for that event and MUST be
        recorded in report.event_failures.
     l. On any failure, record in report.event_failures and continue — do NOT abort;
        the final verdict is false, but the report enumerates every failure.

5. For each Checkpoint COSE_Sign1 c in 040-checkpoints.cbor (in order):
     a. Resolve protected-header kid and verify COSE Sig_structure.
     b. Decode the COSE payload as CheckpointPayload; reject unknown top-level fields.
     c. Recompute Merkle root over canonical_event_hash(events[0..payload.tree_size])
        per §11.3. Check bit-equal to payload.tree_head_hash.
     d. If not the first checkpoint: check payload.prev_checkpoint_hash == digest of prior c.
     e. Verify consistency proof from prior c to current c (§11.4).
   Any failure ⇒ record in report.checkpoint_failures.

6. Posture-transition state continuity. For each event e whose
   EventPayload.extensions carries `trellis.custody-model-transition.v1`
   or `trellis.disclosure-profile-transition.v1` (Posture-transition registry, §6.7):
     a. Decode the extension payload per Companion Appendix A.5.1 / A.5.2.
     b. Check `from_*` state equals the state established by the most recent
        prior transition event of the same kind in the same ledger_scope, or
        equals the deployment's initial declaration if no prior transition
        exists. Mismatch ⇒ record continuity_verified = false and append
        `state_continuity_mismatch` to the outcome's failures list.
        Otherwise record continuity_verified = true.
     c. Resolve `declaration_doc_digest` under domain tag
        `trellis-posture-declaration-v1` (§9.8):
          - If the referenced declaration is absent from the export and is
            not resolvable via a referenced manifest:
              record declaration_resolved = false; continue (not fatal under
              §16's omitted-material semantics).
          - If the referenced declaration is present but its recomputed
            digest does not equal `declaration_doc_digest`:
              record declaration_resolved = false, also set
              continuity_verified = false, and append
              `declaration_digest_mismatch` to the outcome's failures
              list. Digest mismatch is tamper evidence; the fatality
              path is the continuity_verified = false conjunct in step 9.
          - Otherwise record declaration_resolved = true.
     d. Check the required attestation count (Companion §10) and verify
        each attestation's signature under domain tag
        `trellis-transition-attestation-v1` (§9.8). Any failure ⇒
        record attestations_verified = false and append
        `attestation_insufficient` to the outcome's failures list.
        Otherwise record attestations_verified = true.
     e. Emit a PostureTransitionOutcome record (below) into
        report.posture_transitions in event order.
   Localizable failures accumulate in report.posture_transitions; they do
   not short-circuit, and their presence does not by itself fail
   structure_verified. Continuity and attestation failures surface through
   integrity_verified per step 9.

**Attachment manifest (optional, stack ADR 0072).** If `ExportManifestPayload.extensions` carries `trellis.export.attachments.v1` (§6.7), the verifier MUST:

     a. Require the archive member `061-attachments.cbor` (§18.2).
     b. Verify `SHA-256(061-attachments.cbor)` equals `attachment_manifest_digest` in the extension payload and apply `inline_attachments` per ADR 0072.
     c. For each manifest row: resolve `binding_event_hash` to exactly one exported event whose `EventPayload.extensions` carries `trellis.evidence-attachment-binding.v1`; require field-wise agreement between the row and that extension; require `payload_content_hash` equals the event's `EventPayload.content_hash`.
     d. When `inline_attachments = true`, require each referenced ciphertext file `060-payloads/<payload_content_hash>.bin` to exist and to satisfy the ciphertext-hash rule in step 4.g.
     e. For each non-null `prior_binding_hash`, require it resolve to a strict prior event in `010-events.cbor` order (array index strictly less than the binding event's index). Forward references and cycles in the binding-lineage graph MUST be recorded as localizable failures in `report.event_failures`.

**Signature affirmation catalog (optional, WOS Signature Profile).** If `ExportManifestPayload.extensions` carries `trellis.export.signature-affirmations.v1` (§6.7), the verifier MUST:

     a. Require the archive member `062-signature-affirmations.cbor` (§18.2).
     b. Verify `SHA-256(062-signature-affirmations.cbor)` equals `signature_catalog_digest` in the extension payload map.
     c. For each catalog row: resolve `canonical_event_hash` to exactly one exported event whose `EventHeader.event_type` is `wos.kernel.signatureAffirmation`; decode that event's readable payload bytes as the WOS-authored `SignatureAffirmation` provenance record; require field-wise agreement between the catalog row and the decoded record for every field the catalog carries (including signer, role, document hash, consent reference, identity binding, provider, ceremony, profile binding, and `formspecResponseRef`). For nested CBOR maps `identity_binding` and `consent_reference`, comparison MUST be semantic under RFC 8949 §4.2.2 canonical map key ordering (encoded-key bytewise sort), not raw map-entry order in the catalog bytes versus the event payload bytes.
     d. Reject duplicate catalog rows that name the same `canonical_event_hash`.

**Intake-handoff catalog (optional, stack ADR 0073).** If `ExportManifestPayload.extensions` carries `trellis.export.intake-handoffs.v1` (§6.7), the verifier MUST:

     a. Require the archive member `063-intake-handoffs.cbor` (§18.2).
     b. Verify `SHA-256(063-intake-handoffs.cbor)` equals `intake_catalog_digest` in the extension payload map.
     c. Decode the catalog as a dCBOR array whose entries each carry:
        - `intake_event_hash` — admitted `canonical_event_hash` of a `wos.kernel.intakeAccepted` event,
        - `case_created_event_hash` — optional admitted `canonical_event_hash` of a paired `wos.kernel.caseCreated` event,
        - `handoff` — the exact Formspec `IntakeHandoff` object used for the WOS acceptance decision,
        - `response_bytes` — the exact canonical Response envelope bytes whose digest was stored in `handoff.responseHash`.
     d. For each catalog row: resolve `intake_event_hash` to exactly one exported event whose `EventHeader.event_type` is `wos.kernel.intakeAccepted`; decode that event's readable payload bytes as the WOS-authored `IntakeAccepted` provenance record; require the decoded record to name the same intake id (`handoff.handoffId`) and the case disposition implied by `handoff.initiationMode` (`workflowInitiated` attaches to the handoff `caseRef`; `publicIntake` requests governed-case creation under the handoff's pinned Definition).
     e. Recompute the digest named by `handoff.responseHash` over `response_bytes`; mismatch is a localizable integrity failure.
     f. If `case_created_event_hash` is present, resolve it to exactly one exported event whose `EventHeader.event_type` is `wos.kernel.caseCreated`; decode that event's readable payload bytes as the WOS-authored `CaseCreated` provenance record; require field-wise agreement between the decoded record and the handoff evidence refs (`intakeHandoffRef`, `formspecResponseRef`, `validationReportRef`, `ledgerHeadRef`, `initiationMode`) plus the created case ref.
     g. If `handoff.initiationMode = "workflowInitiated"`, `case_created_event_hash` MUST be absent.
     h. If `handoff.initiationMode = "publicIntake"`, `case_created_event_hash` MUST be present.
     i. Reject duplicate catalog rows that name the same `intake_event_hash`.

7. For each inclusion proof ip in 020-inclusion-proofs.cbor:
     a. Recompute Merkle root per ip.audit_path, ip.leaf_hash, ip.leaf_index.
     b. Check it matches the head checkpoint's tree_head_hash.
   Any failure ⇒ record in report.proof_failures.

8. If posture declaration indicates external anchoring:
     - IF the required external material is present: verify per §16.3.
     - IF external material is declared optional: skip without failure.
     - IF required but missing: record report.anchor_unresolved (NOT a verification failure
       under Phase 1, see §16.3, unless the posture declaration itself
       claims external anchoring is required).

9. Compute:
     structure_verified =
       manifest signature valid AND every COSE/CBOR/CDDL structure decoded and signed
       AND no unknown top-level Phase 1 fields were accepted.

     integrity_verified =
       archive digests valid AND event hashes, prev_hash links, checkpoint roots,
       inclusion proofs, consistency proofs, and every available ciphertext hash valid
       AND report.omitted_payload_checks is empty
       AND no entry in report.posture_transitions has continuity_verified = false
       AND no entry in report.posture_transitions has attestations_verified = false.

     readability_verified =
       every payload required by the export scope was decrypted and schema-validated
       under the bound registry and upstream Formspec/WOS semantics.

10. Return report with structure_verified, integrity_verified,
    readability_verified, failures, warnings, and omitted_payload_checks.
```

Implementations record attachment-manifest failures (the optional ADR 0072 step above), signature-affirmation catalog failures (the optional `trellis.export.signature-affirmations.v1` step above), and intake-handoff catalog failures (the optional `trellis.export.intake-handoffs.v1` step above) in `report.event_failures` together with per-event failures from step 4; all such kinds MUST force `integrity_verified = false` under the step-9 definition whenever `report.event_failures` is non-empty.

The verifier's output is a structured report enumerating every integrity observation. The overall convenience boolean MAY be computed as all three booleans true, but implementations MUST expose the three booleans independently. A package that omits ciphertext bytes can still be structurally verified, but it cannot claim payload integrity or readability were verified offline for the omitted payloads.

```cddl
VerificationReport = {
  structure_verified:   bool,
  integrity_verified:   bool,
  readability_verified: bool,
  event_failures:       [* VerificationFailure],
  checkpoint_failures:  [* VerificationFailure],
  proof_failures:       [* VerificationFailure],
  posture_transitions:  [* PostureTransitionOutcome],
  omitted_payload_checks: [* OmittedPayloadCheck],
  warnings:             [* tstr],
}

VerificationFailure = {
  location: tstr,
  code:     tstr,
  detail:   tstr,
}

PostureTransitionOutcome = {
  transition_id:           tstr,   ; from the Posture-transition event payload
  kind:                    tstr,   ; Posture-transition kind: "custody-model" or "disclosure-profile"
  event_index:             uint,   ; position in the events array
  from_state:              tstr,
  to_state:                tstr,
  continuity_verified:     bool,   ; from_state matched prior-transition or initial-declaration state
  declaration_resolved:    bool,   ; declaration_doc_digest resolved to a present declaration
  attestations_verified:   bool,   ; required attestations present + signatures valid
  failures:                [* tstr], ; localized failure codes (continuity_mismatch, declaration_unresolved, attestation_insufficient, ...)
}
```

`declaration_resolved = false` on its own (declaration absent) does not fail `integrity_verified`; it is the honest reporting of omitted material. However, a declaration that IS present in the export but whose recomputed digest does not equal `declaration_doc_digest` is tamper evidence: step 6.c sets both `declaration_resolved = false` AND `continuity_verified = false` in that case, and the latter fails `integrity_verified` via the step-9 conjunction. Callers MAY tighten the absent-declaration case via posture-declaration honesty (§20).

### 19.1 Tamper evidence

When any verification boolean is false, the report identifies specifically **which** canonical bytes or payload checks do not reconcile. This is the "difficult and obvious" property: tampering that rewrites history after an export has been published is detectable by any verifier holding a prior export copy, because the tampered re-export's head will not be a consistent extension of the prior export's head (§11.4). The verifier does not require the tampering party to self-report; consistency-proof failure is the signal.

### 19.2 No network, no fallbacks

The verifier MUST NOT fetch external resources. It MUST NOT fall back to heuristic interpretation of malformed data. It MUST NOT silently skip checks that it lacks material to perform; it MUST record each skipped check in the report.

### 19.3 Time and memory

For an export with `N` events, the verifier runs in time `O(N)` for integrity (one pass over events, one pass over checkpoints) plus `O(M log N)` for the M inclusion proofs. Memory is `O(N)` in the worst case (the canonical-event-hash array to rebuild the tree), or `O(log N)` with streaming tree construction. A Phase 1 reference implementation that does not verify an N = 1,000,000 export on a laptop in under 60 seconds is not a good reference implementation; this is an engineering requirement, not a normative one.

## 20. Trust Posture Honesty

**Requirement class:** Fact Producer, Canonical Append Service, Export Generator.

### 20.1 Normative requirement

Implementations MUST NOT describe their trust posture more strongly than behavior supports. This is invariant #15 lifted normatively.

### 20.2 Required `PostureDeclaration`

Every export manifest (§18.3) MUST include a `PostureDeclaration` with at least the following fields:

```cddl
PostureDeclaration = {
  provider_readable:         bool,                   ; can the service operator decrypt
                                                    ; payloads in ordinary operation?
  reader_held:               bool,                   ; are decryption keys held by the subject or
                                                    ; a subject-designated reader?
  delegated_compute:         bool,                   ; is there any delegated-compute path that
                                                    ; exposes plaintext to a compute agent?
  external_anchor_required:  bool,                   ; does "tamper-evident" depend on an external
                                                    ; anchor beyond this package?
  external_anchor_name:      tstr / null,            ; if required, the name of the dependency
  recovery_without_user:     bool,                   ; can recovery occur without the user's
                                                    ; participation?
  metadata_leakage_summary:  tstr,                   ; human-readable short description of what
                                                    ; metadata remains visible
}
```

### 20.3 Honest field semantics

- `provider_readable = true` means the operator CAN decrypt payloads during ordinary operation. An implementation whose operator holds a reader-wrap copy in the `key_bag` MUST declare `true`. Declaring `false` under these circumstances is a trust-posture-honesty violation.
- `reader_held = true` means the subject or a subject-designated reader holds decryption capability, AND the operator does not hold it in ordinary operation. Both conditions are required; implementations that let the operator hold a "for emergencies" wrap MUST set `reader_held = false` unless the "emergency" is declared in `recovery_without_user` and in the Posture Declaration.
- `delegated_compute = false` means no compute agent, including AI services, is given decryption capability. An LLM-agent workflow that requires payload access to operate MUST declare `true`.
- `external_anchor_required = true` means the "tamper-evident" claim depends on the external anchor named in `external_anchor_name`. Packages that claim tamper-evidence via only the internal signed tree head MUST set `external_anchor_required = false`.
- `recovery_without_user = true` means the service can recover payload access without user participation. This is a key disclosure obligation.
- `metadata_leakage_summary` is non-normative prose; it MUST NOT be used to obscure any of the structured fields.

### 20.4 Legal claims

Cryptographic controls alone MUST NOT be described as legal admissibility. A Phase 1 export verifies integrity and provenance; legal sufficiency in any jurisdiction is governed by upstream obligations (WOS Assurance §6 and analogous regulatory regimes) and is outside the scope of this specification. An implementation MUST NOT embed in its export, its manifest prose, its README, or any accompanying documentation, a claim that the package's Phase 1 verification establishes legal admissibility.

### 20.5 Downgrade protocol

If a deployment discovers that it has overstated its posture (for example, an earlier declaration of `reader_held = true` when the operator had decryption capability), the correction is itself a canonical fact recorded in the response or case ledger, and an update to the posture-transition record. The deployment MUST NOT silently rewrite prior `PostureDeclaration` values; prior exports remain accurate as of their production time, and the correction is a forward event.

---

## 21. Posture / Custody / Conformance-Class Vocabulary

**Requirement class:** All.

### 21.1 The vocabulary problem

Three prior-draft namespaces used the letters A–E/F for three different concerns:

- the Respondent Ledger spec's Profile A/B/C (privacy × identity × integrity-anchoring posture),
- the legacy core draft's seven profiles (Core / Offline / Reader-Held / Delegated-Compute / Disclosure / User-Held / Respondent-History),
- the legacy companion draft's Profiles A–E (provider-readable / reader-held / delegated / threshold / organizational trust-custody models).

These are three orthogonal concerns and MUST NOT share a namespace.

### 21.2 Normative renames

- The Respondent Ledger spec unambiguously owns **"Profile A/B/C"** for posture axes (privacy tier × identity binding × integrity anchoring). Its definitions (Respondent Ledger §15A) are cited here; Trellis does not redefine them.
- The legacy core draft's profiles are renamed **"Conformance Classes"** (what they semantically are). This document defines them in §2.1.
- The legacy companion draft's profiles are renamed **"Custody Models"**. Their definitions move to the Operational Companion; Core only cites the identifier namespace.
- Trellis capability tiers use **phase names** — "attested-export tier" (Phase 1), "runtime-integrity tier" (Phase 2), "portable-case tier" (Phase 3), "federated tier" (Phase 4) — not letters.

### 21.3 Custody models enumerated

Phase 1 recognizes the custody-model identifiers `CM-A` through `CM-F` as values in the Custody Models registry (§26.3). Each identifier is a text string; both the identifier set and its semantics are defined normatively by Trellis Operational Companion §9 (Custody Models), §9.2 (The Six Standard Custody Models) in particular. Core does not restate those definitions: Companion §9.2 is the canonical list, and this section is a pointer.

Phase 2+ MAY register additional models via the Custody Models registry (§26.3). Registration is append-only; semantics do not change after registration.

### 21.4 Scope distinction: event / response ledger / case ledger / agency log / federation log

These are three distinct structures at three distinct scopes, not one term used three ways.

- **Event** (§1.2, §6) — atomic append.
- **Response ledger** — hash-chained sequence of events for one Formspec Response. Owned by Formspec Respondent Ledger semantics for authored meaning; owned by Trellis for envelope integrity.
- **Case ledger** — hash-chained sequence of governance events composing one or more sealed response-ledger heads with WOS governance events. Defined in §24.
- **Agency log** — operator-maintained log of case-ledger heads. Defined in §24.
- **Federation log** — log of agency-log heads witnessed by an independent operator. Phase 4, out of scope for this document.

---

## 22. Composition with Respondent Ledger

**Requirement class:** Fact Producer (Formspec-family), Verifier.

### 22.1 The seam

The Formspec Respondent Ledger specification (in-tree reference: `thoughts/formspec/specs/respondent-ledger-spec.md`; the authoritative upstream RL spec may live in a separate repo under `specs/audit/` — treat the in-tree thoughts copy as the reference for this document) defines the per-response event model, including `eventHash` and `priorEventHash` fields at §6.2 (per-event integrity chaining) and `LedgerCheckpoint` objects at §13 (per-range integrity checkpoints). Respondent Ledger §13.4 explicitly defers "specific signature suite or external anchor" to a downstream layer. Trellis is that downstream layer.

### 22.2 Per-event binding (Track E §21(a))

**When a Trellis envelope wraps a Respondent-Ledger event, Respondent Ledger §6.2 `eventHash` and `priorEventHash` are promoted from SHOULD to MUST.** These are structurally different hashes — the Respondent-Ledger `eventHash` is computed over author-defined JSON per Respondent Ledger §14, while the Trellis `canonical_event_hash` is computed over dCBOR(`CanonicalEventHashPreimage`) under a domain tag per §9.2 — so the binding is a *store-the-digest* rule, not a compute-and-check-equal rule. Concretely, when a Trellis envelope wraps the event:

- The Respondent-Ledger event, serialized per Respondent Ledger §14, MUST appear as the event's plaintext-committed authored-fact material (within the encrypted payload if `reader_held`; within the plaintext audit material if `provider_readable` per the declared posture).
- The Respondent-Ledger `eventHash` field MUST carry the value of the Trellis event's `canonical_event_hash` (§9.2). (The field stores the Trellis digest rather than an independently-computed RL digest.)
- The Respondent-Ledger `priorEventHash` field MUST carry the value of the Trellis event's `prev_hash` (§10.2).

Standalone Respondent Ledger usage without a Trellis envelope retains its own serialization and hash construction per Respondent Ledger §14. This is the integrity-chaining binding that the Respondent Ledger spec names but does not implement on its own. Trellis implements it normatively for Trellis-wrapped Respondent-Ledger events.

### 22.3 Per-range binding (Track E §21(b))

Respondent Ledger §13 `LedgerCheckpoint` and Trellis §11 `Checkpoint` are **different hashes covering different scopes**. The binding between them:

- A Respondent-Ledger `LedgerCheckpoint` (§13.2 minimum fields: `checkpointId`, `ledgerId`, `fromSequence`, `toSequence`, `batchHash`, `signedAt`) is the per-range sealing artifact from the Formspec side.
- A Trellis `Checkpoint` (§11.2) is the signed tree head from the Trellis side.
- When a Trellis envelope wraps a Respondent Ledger, the Trellis `Checkpoint.tree_head_hash` MUST cover exactly the sequence range `[fromSequence, toSequence]` declared by the Respondent Ledger `LedgerCheckpoint`. The Respondent Ledger `LedgerCheckpoint.batchHash` MUST equal the Trellis `Checkpoint.tree_head_hash` for the same `[fromSequence, toSequence]` range (i.e., the batch hash is reproducible from the canonical event hashes in that range under the construction of §11.3, and the result is the tree-head hash).

They are not the same hash, and MUST NOT be conflated; they attest to the same events at different layers (Formspec range vs. Trellis tree).

### 22.4 Case ledger as composition

The **case ledger** is defined normatively as: a Trellis-shaped hash-chained sequence of events whose admitted facts are (a) sealed response-ledger heads (one per Formspec Response associated with the case) plus (b) WOS governance events. The case-ledger event format IS the event format of §6. The composition rule: a sealed response-ledger head appears in a case ledger as an event of `event_type = "trellis.response-head"` whose payload references the sealed response head and whose `commitments` bind the response-ledger's final `tree_head_hash`. A WOS governance event appears as `event_type = "wos.*"` per the WOS-family event taxonomy.

Case-ledger head format is the head format of §11 at a version number (Phase 3) that is a strict superset of Phase 1's version 1 (§18.7).

### 22.5 Response → case composition rule

When a Formspec Response is sealed at submission:

1. The Respondent-Ledger final `LedgerCheckpoint` is produced per Respondent Ledger §13.
2. A Trellis `Checkpoint` is produced per §11 covering the same range.
3. The Trellis `Checkpoint.tree_head_hash` is bound into a new case-ledger event of type `trellis.response-head` whose payload references the Checkpoint.
4. The case ledger's `prev_hash` chain extends by one event.

This is the normative composition rule. It makes the response ledger a *named tributary* of the case ledger without redefining either.

---

## 23. Composition with WOS `custodyHook`

**Requirement class:** Fact Producer (WOS-family), Verifier.

### 23.1 The seam

WOS Kernel §10.5 names `custodyHook` as the seam through which a WOS runtime delegates cryptographic custody to a downstream layer. Trellis is that downstream layer for WOS deployments that adopt it. The seam is directional: WOS emits governance and provenance facts; Trellis admits them as canonical events. Trellis does not initiate WOS state transitions, and a WOS runtime without `custodyHook` adoption is unaffected by this section.

WOS Kernel §10.5 is explicit that the kernel itself does not define the concrete Trust-Profile object; a binding populates the seam. This section is that binding for the Trellis-as-custody-backend case. A monolithic WOS deployment that populates `custodyHook` with an in-process single posture is out of scope here and is governed by WOS Kernel §10.5 directly.

### 23.2 Binding obligations

A WOS runtime using Trellis as its custody backend — hereafter a "WOS-Trellis deployment" — MUST, for every WOS governance or provenance record (WOS Kernel §8 Facts tier and §10.4 `lifecycleHook` outputs) whose custody is routed through the hook:

1. **Envelope.** Produce the record as a Trellis `EventPayload` (§6.1) submitted to the Canonical Append Service under the `ledger_scope` chosen for the WOS case — see §23.3 on scope selection.
2. **Event type.** Populate `EventHeader.event_type` (§12.1) with a registered identifier from the `wos.*` family in the bound registry (§14); §23.4 pins both the namespace-disjointness rule and the outcome-neutrality discipline for `wos.*` identifiers.
3. **Authored payload.** Place the WOS record's authored-fact material — the serialized form WOS Kernel §8 and §10.4 prescribe for that record kind — inside the encrypted payload (`PayloadRef`, §6.4). The Trellis envelope does not restate WOS's authored-fact encoding; it wraps the bytes WOS produces.
4. **Integrity hash.** Use Trellis `canonical_event_hash` (§9.2) as the record's integrity hash wherever WOS Kernel §8 calls for one. A WOS `lifecycleHook` output that stores a hash-of-record for later reference MUST store the Trellis `canonical_event_hash` of the admitting event, not an independently recomputed digest.
5. **Chain.** Chain WOS records via Trellis `prev_hash` (§10.2) in the declared `ledger_scope`. A WOS-Trellis deployment MUST NOT maintain a parallel WOS-side linear chain over the same records; the Trellis chain is the authoritative order. This is the WOS-family analogue of the Respondent-Ledger integrity-chaining binding in §22.2.
6. **Per-range artifact.** Use Trellis `Checkpoint` (§11) as the per-range sealing artifact for any WOS range-level integrity obligation. A WOS deployment that composes case-ledger heads from multiple WOS scopes uses the case-ledger composition of §22.4.
7. **Posture.** Declare a `PostureDeclaration` (§20) covering every `ledger_scope` admitting WOS governance events, and record custody transitions that affect that posture as canonical events per §6.7 / Operational Companion §10 (Posture-Transition Auditability). Custody transitions driven by WOS governance (for example, a WOS-governance decision that alters recovery authority) are posture transitions regardless of the governance body that authored them.

### 23.3 Ledger-scope selection

`ledger_scope` for WOS-Trellis events is chosen by the Operator and MUST satisfy the §10.4 rules without exception. The recommended construction is one `ledger_scope` per WOS case (so that WOS governance events for one case form one chain), with case-ledger composition (§22.4) used when multiple response-ledger scopes must be referenced from the same case's governance chain. `ledger_scope` is signed into every event; a WOS event authored against one case MUST NOT later be replayed into another case's scope, because the domain-separated hashes (§9) would not match.

### 23.4 Event-type namespace and outcome-neutrality

The `wos.*` event-type family is registered in the bound registry (§14) with the same outcome-neutrality discipline that §12.4 pins for all Trellis `event_type` identifiers:

- **Namespace disjointness.** The `wos.*` family and the `trellis.*` family are mutually disjoint. A Trellis-authored envelope whose authored-fact material is not a WOS governance record MUST NOT use a `wos.*` identifier, and a WOS runtime MUST NOT emit a `trellis.*` identifier as its `event_type`. A Trellis processor MUST NOT admit a WOS governance record under a `trellis.*` identifier, and MUST NOT admit a non-WOS authored fact under a `wos.*` identifier.
- Registered `wos.*` identifiers name the governance-record *kind*, not its outcome. `wos.determination`, `wos.review-close`, `wos.assignment`, `wos.adjudication` are conformant shapes; `wos.determination.granted`, `wos.determination.denied`, `wos.review-close.adverse` are NON-CONFORMANT and MUST NOT be registered. WOS outcome is carried in the encrypted payload and in `EventHeader.outcome_commitment` per §12.2.
- `wos.*` identifiers MUST resolve to WOS governance semantics defined by the WOS specification at the registry-bound version (§14.2). A bound-registry entry for a `wos.*` identifier names the WOS spec version it refers to; a registry change that re-points the identifier to a different WOS semantic version is a new registry binding per §14.5.
- The `wos.` prefix is reserved to the WOS specification family in the bound registry. Vendors extending WOS with deployment-local governance records MUST use a registered `x-` identifier under §6.7 that does not shadow any upstream specification's reserved `x-*` prefix (cf. WOS Kernel §10.6, which reserves `x-wos-` for future WOS-normative use). A bare `wos.*` identifier MUST NOT be minted outside the WOS specification family.

### 23.5 Idempotency-key construction for WOS retries

A WOS runtime frequently retries governance submissions — a scheduler redeliver, a saga-compensation retry, a durable-execution replay. Every retry of the same WOS governance decision MUST resolve under §17.3 to the same canonical event, not to a second order position. The WOS-Trellis deployment MUST construct `idempotency_key` (§6.1, §17.2) such that:

- (a) retries of the same authored governance fact produce byte-equal keys,
- (b) distinct authoring attempts produce distinct keys, and
- (c) the construction is computable from identifiers the WOS runtime supplies per its own vocabulary — namely, a case identifier, an identifier for the governance rule or state transition being governed, and a stable per-attempt identifier that the WOS runtime preserves across network-level retries of the same authored attempt.

The recommended construction is a deterministic hash (§17.2) over the canonical encoding (§5) of the WOS-supplied identifier tuple, domain-separated per §9.1. A SHA-256 hash per §9 yields 32 bytes and therefore satisfies the `.size (1..64)` bound on `idempotency_key` in §6.1 by construction. Concrete WOS-side field names and their stability guarantees are normatively the WOS specification's to publish; Trellis does not pin WOS-vocabulary identifiers here. A UUIDv7 ([RFC 9562]) per §17.2 is conformant when the WOS runtime can guarantee one UUIDv7 per logical authored attempt.

For the **WOS-as-custody-backend** binding (Kernel §10.5 `custodyHook` into Trellis), the Operational Companion publishes the operational binding — including the WOS-authored append surface, idempotency inputs, and minimum return shape — in **§24.9**; Core defers WOS vocabulary to WOS and to that companion section rather than duplicating it here.

A WOS-Trellis deployment MUST NOT let the WOS runtime's retry/compensation machinery mint a new `idempotency_key` for the same authored governance decision; the `(ledger_scope, idempotency_key)` identity rule of §17.3 is scope-permanent regardless of WOS-layer retry semantics, and §17.5 `IdempotencyKeyPayloadMismatch` applies when a WOS-layer bug produces a different canonical payload under the same key.

### 23.6 Autonomy-cap mapping

WOS's autonomy vocabulary — `autonomous`, `supervisory`, `assistive`, `manual` (WOS AI Integration §5.2), constrained by the impact-level cap of WOS AI Integration §5.3 — remains authoritative for whether a WOS action may be taken by an AI agent. Trellis does not redefine these levels, re-rank them, or attempt to evaluate the impact-level cap.

When a WOS action is taken by an AI agent under an autonomy level other than `manual`, the corresponding Trellis admission MUST:

1. Declare the event's access class as `delegated_compute` in the Operator's access taxonomy (Operational Companion §8, §19) for every content class the agent read or authored while producing the governance record.
2. Reference a canonical Delegated-Compute Grant (Operational Companion §19.2, Appendix A.6, Appendix B.4) whose scope includes that content class and whose authority attestation (Operational Companion §19.3) names the WOS governance authority that issued the autonomy authorization.
3. Attribute the record under the actor-discriminator rule of Operational Companion §19.4 and OC-70c: `actor_agent_under_delegation` when the governance record is an agent-produced artifact, `actor_human` when a human approver confirmed an `assistive` recommendation before it became canonical.

Trellis does not evaluate whether the WOS autonomy level is conformant with the WOS impact-level cap; that evaluation is WOS's. Trellis attests to the custody and attribution facts. A WOS-conformance failure at the autonomy-cap layer is out of scope for Trellis verification but MUST NOT be masked by a Trellis attestation; see Operational Companion §19.6.

### 23.7 Non-redefinition

Trellis does not alter WOS semantic authority. A WOS runtime's case-state model, deontic ruleset, autonomy caps (WOS AI Integration §5), and governance logic remain WOS-spec bound. Trellis specifies only how the WOS record, once produced, is envelope-wrapped, integrity-bound, and posture-declared. A WOS-conformant runtime and a Trellis-conformant Canonical Append Service compose without either specification changing.

### 23.8 Delegation

When Trellis behavior depends on WOS evaluation semantics — whether a proposed WOS state transition is permitted, whether a WOS deontic check passes, whether a WOS autonomy cap admits an agent-authored attempt — Trellis MUST delegate to a WOS-conformant processor. Trellis does not evaluate WOS rules; it attests to the results WOS produces.

---

## 24. Agency Log (Phase 3 Superset Preview)

**Requirement class:** Canonical Append Service (for Phase 3 agency operators), Verifier.

### 24.1 Normative definition

An **agency log** is an operator-maintained append-only log whose entries are **case-ledger heads** plus arrival metadata and optional witness signatures. It proves that a case existed at time `T` and was not quietly deleted; it is structurally what CT logs are for certificates, applied to cases.

An agency-log entry is, **byte-for-byte, a Phase 1 Checkpoint (§11.2) structure** whose `CheckpointPayload` fields are the Phase 1 fields defined in §11.2, plus registered entries in the reserved `CheckpointPayload.extensions` container for arrival metadata and witness signatures. There are **no top-level agency-log-specific fields**; all agency-log-specific data lives inside `extensions`, under registered identifiers per §6.7. Specifically:

- `trellis.agency_log.arrival_timestamp.v1` — arrival timestamp at the witness-operator at ingest.
- `trellis.agency_log.witness_signature.v1` — optional witness signature(s) attesting to ingest observation.
- `trellis.case_ledger.composed_response_heads.v1` — digests of sealed response-ledger heads composed into this case-ledger head.
- `trellis.case_ledger.case_scope_metadata.v1` — case-scope adjudication metadata (case ID, agency, phase).

A Phase 3 agency-log **entry** is a Trellis event (§6) of `event_type = "trellis.case-head"` whose payload references the case-ledger head by digest; its own `EventPayload.extensions` may likewise carry agency-log arrival metadata. A Phase 3 agency-log **head** is a Trellis checkpoint (§11) whose `CheckpointPayload` preserves the Phase 1 shape of §11.2 unchanged and carries Phase 3 additions only under the registered identifiers in `CheckpointPayload.extensions`.

### 24.2 Phase 1 preservation obligation

Phase 1 MUST reserve head-format extension points that Phase 3 populates. The following Phase 3 fields extend the Phase 1 `CheckpointPayload` only inside `extensions`; a Phase 1 producer MUST NOT emit them, and a Phase 1 verifier MUST preserve and ignore them if encountered in a later-version head (§11.6, §18.7):

- `composed_response_heads: [* digest]` — references to sealed response-ledger heads composed into this case-ledger head.
- `case_scope_metadata: CaseScope` — arrival metadata (case ID, agency, adjudication phase).
- `witness_signatures: [* WitnessSignature]` — cosignatures by independent witnesses (Phase 4 federation).

### 24.3 Why this appears in Phase 1

The agency-log entry format is defined here, at Phase 1, because every Phase 1 checkpoint is a case-ledger-head-compatible artifact by construction. Without this normative reservation, Phase 3 agency-log adoption is a wire-format break for every Phase 1 export already in the field. By naming the reservations now, Phase 1 implementors know what Phase 3 will add and can validate their export shape against it.

### 24.4 Non-goal for Phase 1

Phase 1 does not specify agency-log gossip protocols, witness cosignature mechanics, or federation-log equivocation detection. Those belong to Phase 4. What Phase 1 guarantees is that when they arrive, they do not invalidate anything Phase 1 shipped.

---

## 25. Security and Privacy Considerations

**Requirement class:** Implementers.

### 25.1 Threat model

Trellis is designed against an adversary who controls the operating service, its database, its backup infrastructure, and its administrative console, but does **not** hold signing keys that have been distributed outside the service boundary (subject devices, independent witnesses, customer-held root keys). The goal is to make tampering by such an adversary **difficult and obvious**: difficult because it requires forging signatures, obvious because any reissued export's head is inconsistent with any prior export's head already in third-party hands.

This is not equivocation-proof. An adversary who never distributes exports externally, and who holds all signing keys, can rewrite history silently. Phase 4 transparency witnessing (out of scope for this document) raises the bar to equivocation-proof by requiring independent cosignature; Phase 1 ships the construction that makes Phase 4 additive, not reconstructive.

### 25.2 Metadata leakage

The envelope carries structural fields in plaintext (§12.2). An observer who sees envelopes without decrypting payloads learns:

- event type (limited by the outcome-neutral granularity rule, §12.4),
- timing (at `authored_at` granularity, which MAY be coarsened by the Operational Companion),
- COSE protected-header `kid` (which identifies the signer cohort but not, without correlation, the signer),
- ledger scope identifier (which may identify a case, a workflow, an agency),
- append-head position (which leaks cohort size for the scope).

Implementers MUST consult the metadata budget discipline of the Operational Companion before publishing envelopes to untrusted observers.

### 25.3 Equivocation and split-view

A service presenting different signed tree heads for the same scope to different verifiers is equivocating. Phase 1 detection is passive: verifiers holding different exports that share a scope can compare and detect divergence. Phase 4 elevates this to active detection via witness gossip. A Phase 1 deployment that does NOT distribute exports widely (for example, a single-tenant deployment) has weaker equivocation detection than one that does; this is a property of the deployment, not of the specification.

### 25.4 Side channels

Timing, access pattern, and inclusion-proof request patterns reveal information beyond what is in the envelope. Phase 1 does not mandate oblivious retrieval; deployments that require it declare so in their Posture Declaration and Operational Companion custody model.

### 25.5 Replay

`idempotency_key` (§17) prevents replay-as-duplicate. Replay-as-resubmission (a Fact Producer resubmits an event with the same key to force a retry) is handled by §17.3. Replay of an event from one ledger into another is prevented by the signed `ledger_scope`, the per-scope `prev_hash` chain, and the canonical event hash preimage (§9.2): an event hash includes the ledger scope, and the predecessor chain does not reproduce across scopes.

### 25.6 Key compromise

A compromised signing key invalidates every unrevoked signature the attacker can produce under it. Revocation (status → `Revoked`) is append-only; the compromised key MUST appear as `Revoked` in every subsequent export. Historical signatures under the key remain verifiable against the signing-key registry, but their interpretation depends on whether the compromise predates the signed event; this is a judgment the verifier cannot make from the envelope alone, and SHOULD be surfaced explicitly in the verification report (§19).

### 25.7 Post-quantum migration

Phase 1 ships Ed25519. A cryptographically-relevant quantum computer breaks Ed25519. The migration obligation (§7.3) requires that a 2045 verifier can still resolve 2026 signatures: the `suite_id` is in-band, the signing keys are in the registry, and the digest domain-separators are versioned. Migration to ML-DSA-65 or SLH-DSA-128s, or to a hybrid, registers a new `suite_id` and a new signing key; all prior records remain verifiable under their original suite by any verifier that retains Ed25519 validation code. Implementations that remove Ed25519 support after migration break their own history.

### 25.8 Crypto-shredding interaction with backups

Destroying the per-subject DEK erases plaintext locally. If the ciphertext has been backed up to off-site storage, the backup's plaintext is also erased (same DEK). This is the intended GDPR Art. 17 / FOIA-redaction behavior. An attacker with offline ciphertext and a quantum computer could theoretically recover plaintext if the AEAD succumbs to Shor or Grover; ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD has 256-bit key material and is believed to retain at least 128-bit post-quantum security under Grover. Against that adversary, crypto-shredding reduces to rotating the DEK class wholesale; this is a Phase 2 operational choice and does not affect Phase 1 wire format.

## 26. IANA Considerations

### 26.1 Content type

This specification requests registration of the media type `application/trellis-export+zip` for Phase 1 export packages. File extension: `.ztrellis` or `.zip`. Packages internally identify themselves via the `000-manifest.cbor` payload format field (`"trellis-export/1"`).

### 26.2 `suite_id` registry

A new IANA registry `Trellis Signature Suites` is requested. Registration policy: Specification Required. Initial contents per §7.2. Each registration MUST include: suite identifier, signature algorithm, digest algorithm, reference specification, status.

### 26.3 Custody Models registry

A new IANA-style sub-registry (maintained by the Trellis maintainers until IANA registration, under the shared governance of the Formspec/WOS/Trellis working group) tracks custody-model identifiers per §21.3.

### 26.4 Domain tags

The domain-separation tags enumerated in §9.8 are Trellis-internal and do not require IANA registration; they are documented here for implementor reference.

### 26.5 CBOR tag

No new CBOR tag is requested for Phase 1. Events and checkpoints are plain dCBOR maps; their type is established by their format member (`manifest.format`, explicit `version` fields) and by their archive placement.

---

## 27. Test Vector Requirements

**Requirement class:** All (fixture authorship), Verifier (conformance demonstration).

### 27.1 Coverage minimum

A conformant Phase 1 implementation MUST pass a minimum of **50 language-neutral test vectors** distributed across the following categories, placed under `fixtures/vectors/` in the reference distribution:

| Directory | Count minimum | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `fixtures/vectors/append/` | 10 | Valid append flows: first event, subsequent events, multi-event chains. |
| `fixtures/vectors/verify/` | 15 | Successful verification of complete exports: small, medium, large; single-scope; reader-held; provider-readable. |
| `fixtures/vectors/export/` | 10 | Export-package determinism: same input produces byte-identical ZIP output. |
| `fixtures/vectors/tamper/` | 15 | Detection of tampering: flipped bits in events.cbor, modified signatures, rewritten checkpoints, broken prev_hash chain, unresolvable kid, registry-digest mismatch, out-of-order checkpoints, consistency-proof forgery, substituted content, stripped inclusion proofs. |

### 27.2 Per-vector requirements

Each vector MUST include:

- input: the authored facts (plaintext), the signing keys, the registry snapshot, the idempotency keys, the timestamps,
- expected output: the exact dCBOR bytes of every event, the exact bytes of the checkpoint, the exact ZIP bytes of the export,
- expected verifier verdict: the exact `verified` boolean and a reference `VerificationReport`.

### 27.3 Byte-level claim coverage

Every byte-level claim in this specification MUST correspond to at least one vector. Concretely:

- every `suite_id` value used in Phase 1 has at least one vector,
- every rejection code in §17.5 has at least one negative-case vector,
- every commitment-scheme reservation in §13.3 has at least a shape-vector (not a full scheme implementation),
- every header layer-violation case in §12.2 has at least one negative-case vector.

### 27.4 Cross-implementation byte match

The Phase 1 success criterion (§1 Status) is that a second implementation, written from this specification alone, produces byte-identical output on every `export/` vector and byte-identical verification reports on every `verify/` and `tamper/` vector. Divergence at the byte level — even one-byte divergence — is a conformance failure in one of the two implementations and MUST be diagnosed against this specification, not papered over.

## 29. Appendix B — Example Events and Exports

*This appendix is informative; the authoritative grammar is Appendix A and the authoritative bytes are the fixture vectors (§27).*

**Key-order caveat.** Example payloads in this appendix are shown with keys in a logical/reading order for human orientation. Actual dCBOR serialization MUST sort map keys in byte-wise lexicographic order of their canonical CBOR encoding per §5.1; for example, in `EventPayload` the first three keys by that ordering are `version` (`0x67 …`), `sequence` (`0x68 …`), `ledger_scope` (`0x6c …`), not `version → ledger_scope → sequence`. The authoritative bytes for every worked example live in `fixtures/vectors/append/...` and related fixture directories; where the prose below and the fixtures disagree, the fixtures are normative.

### 29.1 A minimal first event (hex-decoded dCBOR)

A Formspec `session.started` event, the first in a response ledger. Values are schematic: digest bytes truncated to `01 02 03 …` placeholders; real fixtures will use actual cryptographic outputs.

Decoded COSE payload structure:

```
EventPayload {
  version: 1,
  ledger_scope: h'7265732d303030303031',   ; "res-000001"
  sequence: 0,
  prev_hash: null,
  causal_deps: null,
  author_event_hash: h'01010101...32bytes',
  content_hash: h'02020202...32bytes',     ; SHA-256 over ciphertext
  header: {
    event_type: h'666f726d737065632e617574686f726564', ; "formspec.authored" bytes
    authored_at: 1744963200,               ; 2026-04-18T00:00:00Z
    retention_tier: 1,
    classification: h'7075626c6963',       ; "public"
    outcome_commitment: null,
    subject_ref_commitment: h'03030303...32bytes',
    tag_commitment: null,
    witness_ref: null,
    extensions: null
  },
  commitments: null,
  payload_ref: {
    ref_type: "inline",
    ciphertext: h'baadf00d...N-bytes',
    nonce: h'06060606...12bytes'
  },
  key_bag: {
    entries: [
      {
        recipient: h'7265616465722d686f6c64', ; "reader-hold"
        suite: 1,                             ; HPKE Base X25519 + HKDF-SHA256 + ChaCha20-Poly1305
        ephemeral_pubkey: h'04040404...32bytes',
        wrapped_dek: h'05050505...N-bytes'
      }
    ]
  },
  idempotency_key: h'0189b2c0...16bytes',  ; UUIDv7
  extensions: null
}
```

The wire event is a COSE_Sign1 value whose protected header includes `alg = -8`, `kid = h'deadbeef...16bytes'`, and `suite_id = 1`, and whose payload is the dCBOR bytes above.

Hex dump of the EventPayload dCBOR serialization (first bytes shown schematic):

```
aD                           ; map(13) — the EventPayload map
  67 76 65 72 73 69 6f 6e    ; "version"
  01                          ; 1
  6c 6c 65 64 67 65 72 ...    ; "ledger_scope"
  4a 72 65 73 2d ...          ; h'res-...'
  68 73 65 71 75 65 6e 63 65 ; "sequence"
  00                          ; 0
  ...                        ; remaining fields in lexicographic key order
```

(Full byte-level dump is in `fixtures/vectors/append/001-minimal-first-event.cbor.hex`.)

### 29.2 A signed checkpoint

```
CheckpointPayload {
  version: 1,
  scope: h'7265732d303030303031',          ; "res-000001"
  tree_size: 7,
  tree_head_hash: h'aabbccdd...32bytes',
  timestamp: 1744974000,
  anchor_ref: null,
  prev_checkpoint_hash: null,              ; first checkpoint of the scope
  extensions: null
}
```

The wire checkpoint is a COSE_Sign1 value over this payload with protected-header `alg`, `kid`, and `suite_id`.

### 29.3 Export manifest

```
ExportManifestPayload {
  format: "trellis-export/1",
  version: 1,
  generator: "trellis-cli/0.1.0",
  generated_at: 1744974100,
  scope: h'7265732d303030303031',
  tree_size: 7,
  head_checkpoint_digest: h'ffeeddcc...32bytes',
  registry_bindings: [
    {
      registry_digest: h'11223344...32bytes',
      registry_format: 1,
      registry_version: "2026.04",
      bound_at_sequence: 0
    }
  ],
  signing_key_registry_digest: h'...',
  events_digest: h'...',
  checkpoints_digest: h'...',
  inclusion_proofs_digest: h'...',
  consistency_proofs_digest: h'...',
  payloads_inlined: true,
  external_anchors: [],
  posture_declaration: {
    provider_readable: false,
    reader_held: true,
    delegated_compute: false,
    external_anchor_required: false,
    external_anchor_name: null,
    recovery_without_user: false,
    metadata_leakage_summary: "Envelope reveals event_type, authored_at (1s granularity), retention_tier, classification, and protected-header kid. Outcome, subject, and tags are committed, not plaintext."
  },
  head_format_version: 1,
  omitted_payload_checks: [],
  extensions: null
}
```

The wire `000-manifest.cbor` member is a COSE_Sign1 value over this payload with protected-header `alg`, `kid`, and `suite_id`.

### 29.4 Worked verification trace

Given `trellis-export-res-000001-7-ffeeddcc.zip` (the export of §29.1–29.3), a verifier runs:

```
1. Open ZIP. Layout deterministic? yes.
2. Read 000-manifest.cbor. Verify COSE_Sign1 ⇒ valid.
3. Check archive digests:
     SHA-256(010-events.cbor)       = manifest.events_digest        ✓
     SHA-256(040-checkpoints.cbor)  = manifest.checkpoints_digest   ✓
     (etc.)
4. For each event e_0..e_6:
     verify signature          ✓
     recompute canonical_event_hash ✓
     recompute author_event_hash   ✓
     verify content_hash       ✓
     verify prev_hash chain    ✓
     causal_deps null          ✓ (Phase 1)
     registry binding resolves ✓
5. For the single checkpoint c_7:
     verify signature          ✓
     recompute Merkle root     ✓ = c_7.tree_head_hash
     prev_checkpoint_hash null ✓ (first checkpoint)
6. For each inclusion proof:
     recompute root            ✓
7. No external anchors declared; skip.
8. verified = true.
9. Return (true, report with 0 failures).
```

A tamper fixture `fixtures/vectors/tamper/005-flipped-byte-in-event-3.zip` modifies one byte of `events[3].payload_ref.ciphertext`. On re-run:

```
4. Event e_3: content_hash mismatch ⇒ report.event_failures[3] = content_hash_mismatch
            : author_event_hash mismatch (covers ciphertext) ⇒ report.event_failures[3] += author_event_hash_mismatch
            : signature verification fails ⇒ report.event_failures[3] += signature_invalid
5. checkpoint c_7: Merkle root mismatch ⇒ report.checkpoint_failures[0] = tree_head_hash_mismatch
   (because event e_3's canonical_event_hash changed)
8. verified = false.
```

The report localizes the tamper to sequence 3 and to the ciphertext field specifically, across three independent checks.
