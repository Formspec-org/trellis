# Trellis Test Vectors

## Directory layout

```
fixtures/vectors/
├── append/NNN-slug/         # one directory per vector
├── verify/NNN-slug/
├── export/NNN-slug/
├── tamper/NNN-slug/
├── _keys/                   # pinned COSE_Key bytes + README
├── _inputs/                 # pinned payloads / prior heads + README
└── _generator/              # Python authoring aid (non-normative, §7)
```

Ordering within each op-dir is lexicographic via prefix (`001-`, `002-`, …). Underscored directories signal non-vector scaffolding and are excluded from conformance-runner walks.

## Vector contract

Operation-first tagged union. Each vector declares its `op` in its manifest and carries op-specific inputs and expected outputs. The runner dispatches on `op` rather than on directory placement — a vector is self-describing and relocatable.

- **append** — `(prior_head?, signing_key, authored_event) → (canonical_event, signed_event, next_head)`. Runner byte-compares outputs against committed sibling files.
- **verify** — `(ledger_artifact) → VerificationReport`. Runner compares report fields (`structure_verified`, `integrity_verified`, `readability_verified`) against inline expected.
- **export** — `(ledger_state) → zip_bytes`. Runner byte-compares ZIP bytes against committed expected; `zip_sha256` in the manifest is a convenience mirror, not the acceptance check.
- **tamper** — `(tampered_artifact) → VerificationReport` where at least one `*_verified` flag is false. Runner compares failure kind + failing event id.

Manifest input/expected fields mirror whatever Core says each API's signature is. This spec does not re-normatize the API — it reflects Core.

## Conformance runner contract

Vectors are pure data. There is no shared runner protocol. Each implementation writes its own runner in its own language; implementations couple only through the committed vector bytes.

Runner responsibilities:

- Walk `fixtures/vectors/{append,verify,export,tamper}/*/`, ignoring `_`-prefixed siblings.
- Parse `manifest.toml`, dispatch on `op`.
- Load inputs; invoke the local `append` / `verify` / `export` API.
- For `append` / `export`: byte-compare output against expected sibling files.
- For `verify` / `tamper`: compare report fields against inline `[expected.report]`.

A shared stdin/stdout protocol was considered and rejected. It would dilute the stranger test by introducing a second normative artifact beyond Core — "did I implement the protocol right?" competing with "did I implement Core right?" Data-only preserves the ratification bar.
