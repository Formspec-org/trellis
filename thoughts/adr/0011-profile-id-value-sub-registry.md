# ADR 0011 — Retired Dispatch-Label Value Sub-Registry

**Status:** Superseded 2026-05-16 by ADR 0109

## Context

Trellis Core had assigned COSE protected-header label `-65539` to integer dispatch, but the spec did not yet define the value registry carried under that label. UWU-1 in `formspec-stack/thoughts/archive/plans/2026-05-12-integrity-stack-case-boundary-refactor.md` Phase 9 allocated the Formspec authored-signature dispatch value, and the verifier dispatcher needed a canonical registry home.

## Decision

1. Trellis Core §26.2.1 was the canonical value sub-registry for retired label `-65539`.
2. Values are sequential `u64` allocations starting at 1.
3. Allocated values at this decision:
   - `1` = WOS workflow event.
   - `2` = Formspec authored signature.
4. The stack-root dispatch-value registry mirror is historical only.

## Consequences

- `integrity-verify` no longer declares active constants for the retired dispatch values.
- Formspec Core §2.1.6 no longer routes authored signatures through label `-65539`; ADR 0109 moved consumer detached-signature dispatch to `method_uri` at label `-65540`.
- No new values may be allocated under this ADR family, Trellis §26.2.1, or the historical stack-root mirror.
