# CLAUDE.md — Trellis

Cryptographic integrity substrate beneath Formspec (intake) and WOS (governance). Parent [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) carries stack-wide conventions (HIGH PRIORITY writing rule, dev philosophy, worktrees, Red-Green-Refactor, Test-Before-Fix, commit convention). This file carries only Trellis-specific deltas and pointers.

## Engineering philosophy — Trellis-specific deltas

- **Nothing is released.** `v1.0.0` is a coherent-snapshot tag, not a freeze. Zero production records exist. If a wire-shape change prevents architectural debt, make it and retag. Only real adopters close the revision window; there are none.
- **Rust is the byte authority (ADR 0004).** For anything spec prose cannot pin — CBOR ordering, COSE headers, ZIP metadata, Merkle steps, domain separation tags — Rust is canonical. Python (`trellis-py/`) is the cross-check. When they disagree: update spec prose if load-bearing and under-specified, update Python to match, add a vector if coverage was missing.
- **Maximalist envelope, restrictive Phase-1 runtime.** Reserve capacity in the wire shape now. Enforce Phase-1 scope with lint + runtime constraints, never by omitting capacity.
- **No stubs.** `unimplemented!()` / `todo!()` / `NotImplementedError` are forbidden unless the blocker is an unresolved architectural decision — in which case STOP and surface it.
- **Vectors and Rust move together.** New `fixtures/vectors/` contract lands with matching `trellis-conformance` coverage in the same change train.
- **Spec + matrix + fixture in the same commit.** Every normative MUST has a `TR-CORE-*` / `TR-OP-*` row and (where testable) a byte-exact fixture.
- **Historical material is non-normative.** `specs/archive/` and `thoughts/archive/` — do not cite as normative.

## Decision heuristics

Apply after stack-wide heuristics (in vision-model.md):

1. **Phase-check.** Phase 1 (SBA PoC, single-agency intake) or Phase 2+? Phase 2+ defers; Phase 4 version-bumps the envelope regardless.
2. **Architectural-debt check.** Would keeping the current shape make a future change more expensive than changing now? If yes, change it.
3. **Byte-authority check.** Byte-level question? Rust is the oracle (ADR 0004).
4. **Reservation discipline.** New envelope field / hash slot / extension hook? YES at envelope layer if Phase-1 runtime restriction stays clean; runtime NO until the phase opens.

## Architecture

**Logic ownership.** Rust is the byte authority (ADR 0004). Python (`trellis-py/`) is the cross-check. When bytes disagree with prose, Rust wins and spec prose updates.

**Canonical encoding + signature suite.** dCBOR (RFC 8949 §4.2.2). Ed25519 over COSE_Sign1 (`alg = -8`), with `suite_id` registry reserving ML-DSA / SLH-DSA / hybrid codepoints. SHA-256 hash construction with domain separation tags. HPKE Base-mode payload-key wrap. COSE_Sign1 checkpoints over `(tree_size, tree_head_hash, suite_id, timestamp, anchor_ref?)`.

**Center-vs-adapter.** Center: `trellis-core` + `trellis-types` + `trellis-cddl` + `trellis-cose` + `trellis-verify`. Traits: storage, KMS, anchor target. Adapters: `trellis-store-memory`, `trellis-store-postgres`; anchor substrates via `AnchorAdapter` trait (adopters pick OpenTimestamps / Rekor / Trillian per-deployment; see spike in `thoughts/specs/2026-04-24-anchor-substrate-spike.md`).

**Verification independence contract** (Core §16) is load-bearing: verifiers MUST NOT depend on derived artifacts, workflow runtime, or mutable DBs. Keep `trellis-verify` free of non-essential dependencies.

## Spec authoring contract

- CDDL inside `trellis-core.md` is structural authority. Rust type definitions MUST match. When they disagree, Rust wins per ADR 0004; update the CDDL.
- Behavioral semantics that CDDL cannot encode live in normative prose of `trellis-core.md` and `trellis-operational-companion.md`.
- Every testable normative row in `specs/trellis-requirements-matrix.md` SHOULD have a byte-exact fixture in `fixtures/vectors/`. `check-specs.py` enforces coverage.

## Build & test

```bash
# Targeted
cargo check --workspace
cargo test -p trellis-core
cargo test -p trellis-verify
cargo test -p trellis-conformance         # full-corpus replay (G-4 oracle)

# Full
cargo test --workspace
cd trellis-py && python3 -m pytest -q     # stranger cross-check (G-5 oracle)
python3 scripts/check-specs.py            # spec discipline + fixture coverage

# Batched vector rollout only
TRELLIS_SKIP_COVERAGE=1 python3 scripts/check-specs.py
```

`make help` lists Makefile targets.

## Working norms — Trellis-specific

- **Inline by default for work under ~30 minutes.** Subagents earn their keep via isolation, parallelism, or genuinely large scope.
- **Plans: 3–5 tasks max.** If a plan wants 12 tasks, it is probably two plans.
- **Doc updates travel with the thing they document.** A commit adding a new Core §N also adds the corresponding `TR-CORE-NNN` row; closing a gate updates the checklist in the same commit.
- **Skill ceremony is optional when design is settled.** `superpowers:brainstorming` only when design space is genuinely open.
- **Parallel by default for independent work.** Use `run_in_background: true` for parallel subagents and follow-on vector batches.
- **Trust the model; prompt less.** Give the subagent the goal, the constraints, and the escalation rules.
- **Escalation over fabrication.** Return `NEEDS_CONTEXT` instead of papering over blockers with stubs.

## Submodule awareness

Checked out as `formspec/trellis/` inside the parent repo. Commits here are separate from parent commits — bump the parent submodule pointer when landing meaningful work. Never `--amend`, `--force`, or `--no-verify` without owner sanction. AI-authored commits end with:
