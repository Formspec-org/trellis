# Trellis verifier-isolation CI assertion.
#
# Asserts that `trellis-verify`'s dependency graph does NOT include any
# HPKE-or-related crypto crate. The Phase-1 verifier MUST stay free of
# HPKE so an offline core-bytes verify (Core §16 — Verification
# Independence) does not pull in the HPKE / X25519 / AEAD / HKDF
# transitive graph.
#
# Why the sibling-crate architecture rests on this:
#   - `trellis-hpke` is a sibling crate at the same level as
#     `trellis-core` / `trellis-cose`. The boundary is what makes Core
#     §16 enforceable structurally (not just by prose discipline).
#   - A future change to `trellis-cose` that pulls `trellis-hpke` in as
#     a dep would silently breach the verifier-isolation invariant
#     because every consumer of `trellis-cose` (including
#     `trellis-verify`) would inherit HPKE.
#   - This script is the loud-fail gate: `cargo tree -p trellis-verify`
#     MUST NOT mention `hpke`, `x25519-dalek`, `chacha20poly1305`, or
#     `hkdf`. Run via `make check-verifier-isolation` (Trellis-local)
#     or directly in CI.
#
# Authority:
#   - Core §16 (Verification Independence)
#   - ADR 0009 §"Architectural posture" (sibling-crate boundary)
#   - ADR 0008 §ISC-05 (same hygiene contract for ecosystem libs)
#   - `crates/trellis-hpke/Cargo.toml` `# DO NOT BUMP` block (cites
#     this script as the firewall)
