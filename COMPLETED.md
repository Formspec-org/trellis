# Trellis — COMPLETED

Historical rollup of landed Trellis work. Organized wave-by-wave.

**This file is for:** wave dispatch history, closed sprint-queue items, closed
stream items, completed critical-path steps. Anyone asking "what's been
done?" reads this.

**This file is not for:** active tactical work (→ [`TODO.md`](TODO.md)),
strategy (→ [`thoughts/product-vision.md`](thoughts/product-vision.md)),
ratification scope (→ [`ratification/ratification-checklist.md`](ratification/ratification-checklist.md)),
or implementation plans (→ [`thoughts/specs/`](thoughts/specs/)).

Prune aggressively — `git log` is the real record. Entries here capture
cross-commit wave context that a raw log cannot reconstruct.

## Wave-by-wave dispatch history

### Wave 14 (2026-04-24) — ADR 0006/0007, HPKE + anchor spikes, shared-bundle design

Rounded out the decision-document set that the 2026-04-23 audit sweep
surfaced as gaps, plus landed the DI-first anchor-substrate stance.

- **ADR 0006 — Key-class taxonomy.** Core §8's `SigningKeyEntry` generalized
  to a tagged-union `KeyEntry` with five variants: `signing`, `tenant-root`,
  `scope`, `subject`, `recovery`. Phase-1 CDDL lands all five as envelope-
  reserved; Phase-1 runtime restricts emission to `signing` only. Unblocks
  ADR 0005 `key_class` enum alignment and Phase-2+ custody models CM-D /
  CM-F. Lands at `thoughts/adr/0006-key-class-taxonomy.md`.
- **ADR 0007 — Certificate-of-completion composition.** `trellis.certificate-
  of-completion.v1` canonical event binds a human-readable PDF/HTML artifact
  to a signing-workflow completion event via ADR 0072 attachment path +
  chain-derived `ChainSummary` the verifier cross-checks. PDF rendering NOT
  normatively pinned; gross PDF-vs-chain divergence is detectable. Nine-step
  implementation arc; seven-vector fixture plan. Closes the DocuSign-
  replacement pitch in engineering terms. Lands at
  `thoughts/adr/0007-certificate-of-completion-composition.md`.
- **HPKE crate selection spike.** Picks `hpke` (rozbb/rust-hpke) for the
  Rust wrap/unwrap path. Pure Rust, single-shot API matches per-KeyBagEntry
  usage, PQ-suite migration path via KEM-generic traits. Interface sketch
  + verification approach pinned for sequence item #6. Lands at
  `thoughts/specs/2026-04-24-hpke-crate-spike.md`.
- **Anchor substrate spike — DI-first.** Does NOT pick OpenTimestamps vs
  Rekor vs Trillian. Declares an `AnchorAdapter` trait + enumerates three
  first-class candidate adapters. Adopters pick per-deployment; multi-
  adapter deployments are native via ADR 0002's list-form `external_anchors`.
  Keeps ε (vision-model anchor-substrate uncertainty) formally open at
  the center while giving adopters a stable trait contract. Lands at
  `thoughts/specs/2026-04-24-anchor-substrate-spike.md`.

Parent-repo landing same session:

- **Shared cross-seam fixture bundle design.** Parent monorepo hosts
  `fixtures/stack-integration/` with per-scenario bundles combining
  Formspec canonical response + WOS provenance events + Trellis export
  bundle + pinned expected cross-layer verifier report. Full-stack
  analogue of Trellis G-5. Three Phase-1 bundles planned (WOS-T4
  signature-complete, ADR 0073 public-create, ADR 0073 workflow-attach).
  Lands at `formspec/thoughts/specs/2026-04-24-shared-cross-seam-fixture-
  bundle-design.md`.

### Wave 13 (2026-04-24) — TODO structural flattening

Collapsed Trellis TODO from ten numbered streams plus separate Deferred
and Sustaining sections into one sequenced list of 22 open items, each
carrying its prerequisite inline. Removed redundant `Phase 1` tags on
open-work items (all Phase-1 by default); kept Phase-2/3/4 tags where
they differentiate. Stripped landed-status narrative from the
WOS-T4 and ADR-0073 Stream bodies — COMPLETED.md holds that history.
Parent TODO + cross-refs updated. No content lost; structure flatter.

### Wave 12 (2026-04-23) — audit sweep + ADR 0005 + G-O-5 re-close

Closed out the 2026-04-23 design-doc audit sweep in three phases:

- **O-5 disclosure-profile verifier gap closed.** Rust `trellis-verify`
  and Python stranger both extended to decode
  `trellis.disclosure-profile-transition.v1` in addition to the custody-
  model axis. `tamper/016-disclosure-profile-from-mismatch` is the
  negative oracle. G-O-5 was retroactively reopened in the ratification
  checklist on 2026-04-23 after the audit surfaced the gap, then
  re-closed the same day once the Rust + Python + vector arrived.
  Verified by `cargo test -p trellis-conformance` +
  `python3 -m trellis_py.conformance` (63 vectors, 0 failures).
- **ADR 0005 — Crypto-erasure evidence.** Adopts explicit
  `trellis.erasure-evidence.v1` event over the absence-is-evidence
  alternative. Extension-slot wire shape, chain-cross-check verifier
  obligation, Companion §20 rewrite (OC-78 promotion + new OC-79/80/81),
  optional export catalog. Closes the DocuSign-replacement positioning
  claim around provable crypto-shredding. Lands at
  `thoughts/adr/0005-crypto-erasure-evidence.md`. Execution arc is
  Trellis TODO sequence item #8.
- **Audit execution.** Archived nine landed design briefs from
  `thoughts/specs/` (six in Group A clean archive + two in Group B
  needing citation migration + one cross-cutting doc); promoted the
  Phase-1 ADR 0001-0004 set + the new ADR 0005 from `thoughts/specs/`
  into a new Trellis-local `thoughts/adr/` tree; updated citations in
  Trellis TODO / CLAUDE.md / product-vision.md and parent
  vision-model.md; deleted the stale auto-memory file that duplicated
  the ADR content. §8.6 HPKE wording tightened to match §9.4 semantics.
  `thoughts/specs/` emptied; new design work lands there before
  promotion or archive.

### Wave 11 (working tree) — ADR 0072 attachment export closure

Closed the Trellis-side Phase-1 evidence-integrity export batch:

- Added deterministic fixture generation for `export/005-attachments-inline`,
  `verify/013-export-005-missing-attachment-body`, and
  `tamper/013-attachment-manifest-digest-mismatch`.
- Landed `061-attachments.cbor` fixture coverage bound through
  `ExportManifestPayload.extensions["trellis.export.attachments.v1"]`, with
  inline attachment ciphertext under `060-payloads/`.
- Extended the Rust verifier to check the attachment-manifest digest, resolve
  each `binding_event_hash` to an event carrying
  `trellis.evidence-attachment-binding.v1`, compare manifest fields to the
  chain-authored binding, and reject missing inline attachment bodies.
- Reconciled TODO / executable-dispatch state so ADR 0072 has no remaining
  Trellis-side task in the current Phase-1 batch.

### Wave 10 (working tree) — G-5 close and 1.0.0 ratification

Closed ratification after the clean-room stranger pass landed:

- Bound the `trellis-py/` evidence bundle into
  `ratification/ratification-checklist.md` and flipped G-5 to closed.
- Reissued `specs/trellis-core.md` and
  `specs/trellis-operational-companion.md` as `1.0.0`.
- Updated repo-facing status text so active docs no longer describe the
  ratified surface as draft-only.
- Cut the first Trellis release tag for the ratified 1.0.0 surface.

### Wave 9 (working tree) — G-2 traceability cleanup

Closed the remaining local ratification bookkeeping before G-5:

- Added explicit `Core §N` / `Companion §N` anchors to every
  `spec-cross-ref` matrix row that lacked one.
- Flipped G-2 in `ratification/ratification-checklist.md` after
  byte-vector, model-check, declaration-doc, projection-drill, and
  spec-cross-ref evidence all had live checks or fixtures.
- Reconciled `TODO.md` and the executable dispatch doc: O-3/O-4/O-5 are
  closed, the G-5 commission brief exists, and ratification close-out is
  blocked on the independent G-5 implementation only.
- Packaged the tracked G-5 allowed read set under `ratification/g5-package/`
  with per-file and archive SHA-256 checksums. The package excludes forbidden
  paths and untracked workspace files.
- Accepted the Trellis-side custodyHook wire-format note and regenerated
  `append/010-wos-custody-hook-state-transition` on the accepted ADR-0061
  shape: dCBOR authored WOS bytes, TypeID-shaped `caseId` / `recordId`, and
  the two-field `trellis-wos-idempotency-v1` idempotency construction.

### Wave 8 (4 commits `ee57780..b0f114d`) — Wave 6 tail closure

Closed out the Wave 6 tail that had been sitting in the working tree. Four
slices in dependency order:

- `ee57780` — Core amendments: §9.4 HPKE freshness (per-`KeyBagEntry`
  ephemeral uniqueness + fixture test-vector carve-out), §6.4
  ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD pin, §6.7 `trellis.staff-view-decision-binding.v1`
  extension-registry row, §19 step 4.k verifier obligation, §28 Appendix A
  CDDL additions (`StaffViewDecisionBinding` + optional
  `projection_schema_id` on `Watermark`). Retroactively satisfies
  `projection/005`'s §6.7 + §28 Appendix A citations.
- `fd54232` — `tamper/004` `tamper_kind` reconciled to canonical
  `posture_declaration_digest_mismatch` per `tamper/001`'s enum.
- `4cc9fe8` — `append/004-hpke-wrapped-inline` vector + 2 pinned X25519 keys
  (`recipient-004-ledger-service`, `ephemeral-004-recipient-001`) under
  `_keys/`. Depends on `ee57780`. Claims TR-CORE-031 + TR-CORE-038.
- `b0f114d` — Lint R9/R10/R11 + 122 new pytest lines + SSDI event-registry
  stub (`fixtures/declarations/ssdi-intake-triage/event-registry.stub.md`).
  Closes Wave 1 lint-refactor plan commits 5-6.

Net state: 25 vectors (up from 24); all six Wave-1 lint rules live; Core
§§6.4/6.7/9.4/19/28 amendments landed. check-specs.py green; pytest 92/92;
renumbering guard green.

### Wave 7 (6 commits `964716c..dd0d1da`) — residue batch + review-fix

5 new fixtures + semi-formal-review-fix pass + TODO refresh.

- `964716c` — residue-batch: `append/009-signing-key-revocation`
  (TR-CORE-037 + TR-CORE-070; §8 Active→Revoked + §14.3 RegistryBinding
  digest; discharges the last `pending_invariants` entries),
  `projection/005-watermark-staff-view-decision-binding` (TR-OP-006;
  staff-view §15.2 Watermark + §28 Appendix A StaffViewDecisionBinding;
  closes final O-3 breadth item), `tamper/006-event-reorder` (TR-CORE-020;
  step 4.h swap).
- `8ba1f59` — TODO refresh for the residue batch.
- `4ae9d3c` — semi-formal-review fix pass (verdict REQUEST CHANGES on
  `964716c`; 1 blocker + 2 warnings fixed in-patch): `§29.3 → §28 Appendix
  A` citation drift (8 places across projection/005
  manifest/derivation/generator), stale `tamper/006` forward-reference
  removed, TR-CORE-023 added to `tamper/006`.
- `f69f9e4` — symmetric TR-CORE-023 claim on `tamper/005-chain-truncation`.
- `914f032` — `tamper/007-hash-mismatch` (§19 step 4.d; re-signed tampered
  `author_event_hash`; TR-CORE-020+023+061).
- `dd0d1da` — `tamper/008-malformed-cose` (§19 structural-identification;
  CBOR tag-flip 18→17; TR-CORE-035+060+061; closes TR-CORE-060 from the
  allowlist).

Net allowlist state: `pending_invariants = []`; `pending_matrix_rows` drops
TR-CORE-037 / TR-CORE-070 / TR-CORE-060 / TR-OP-006 (and TR-OP-006 also
drops from `_pending-projection-drills.toml`). 92/92 pytest, check-specs
green (warnings only), renumbering guard green (23 base prefixes). Corpus:
24 vectors.

### Wave 6 (2 commits `992fbc1..6b20ef3`)

4 parallel in-tree agents (no worktrees). Landed `tamper/005-chain-truncation`
(TR-CORE-020, Core §19 step 4.h pin; first expanded-tamper case, `992fbc1`)
and §9.4 HPKE-freshness decision memo recommending Option (a) amendment
(`6b20ef3`, `thoughts/specs/2026-04-19-trellis-hpke-freshness-decision.md`).
Stream D O-5 semi-formal review completed (verdict REQUEST CHANGES, 1
blocking-style finding + 1 nit + 6 notes; Finding 1 is the `tamper_kind`
enum-name drift between `tamper/001` and `tamper/004`). `projection/005`
authoring agent halted cleanly on a Phase-1 extension-registry spec blocker.
3 new spec-amendment tasks surfaced: `tamper_kind` reconcile, register
`trellis.staff-view-decision-binding.v1`, land Core §9.4 HPKE amendment.
89/89 pytest; check-specs + renumbering guard green (18 base prefixes).

### Wave 5 (9 commits `334bb75..552c142`)

4 parallel code-scout agents + working-tree commit-split. Landed:
`shred/002-backup-refusal` (`334bb75`), lint commit 4 R6+R8 including new
`_pending-model-checks.toml` scaffolding (`d9f228a`), Stream D O-5 bundle
`append/006..008` + `tamper/002..004` (`dbdfe0a` + `814b2fe`),
`append/002-rotation-signing-key` rebased from worktree (`4585646`), lint
commit 3 R4-R5/R7 fixture corpora + pre-merge renumbering guard
(`0fcee6f`), Companion A.6 ambiguity amendment (`65090f8`), Wave 5 fixture
batch `append/003` + `projection/002-004` + `tamper/001` (`905668b`),
TODO refresh (`552c142`). Allowlist 2 invariants + 54 rows + 5
projection-drill + 8 model-check; 89/89 pytest; `check-specs.py` +
`check-vector-renumbering.py --base-ref HEAD` green.

### Wave 4 (6 commits `248781f..00042c4`)

`append/005-prior-head-chain` vector (closes #10/#13, TR-CORE-020/023/050/080);
SSDI intake-triage reference O-4 declaration at `fixtures/declarations/`;
first O-3 projection + shred fixtures (Test 1 watermark + Test 4
purge-cascade); Wave 1 lint refactor commits 1-2 (shared plumbing + R1
fixture-naming guard + R3 projection-drills loader, 30→52 pytest); 10
WOS-binding review findings applied.

### Wave 3 (5 commits + 1 review)

`append/005` brainstorm (corrected TODO invariant mislabels; pinned serial
order 005→003→004→002→tamper); Wave 1 lint-refactor plan (6 S-commits
phased); WOS custodyHook ↔ Trellis binding (Core §23 4→8 subsections +
Companion §24 OC-113a/b/c/d/e + Appendix B.2 extensions); G-4 Rust workspace
plan (10 crates, 5 layers, M1 six sub-milestones); F6 deprecation-field
lint + F1/F2/F5/F8 review-nits cleanup.

### Wave 2 spec edits (`cfd587b..1233e02`)

Core §§6.5/6.7/9.8/15.2/15.3/19 (Posture-transition registry,
`trellis-posture-declaration-v1` + `trellis-transition-attestation-v1`
domain tags, `projection_schema_id` reconciliation, dCBOR rebuild encoding,
verification algorithm step 5.5 + `PostureTransitionOutcome`); Companion
§§10.3/16.2/19.9/20.5 + Appendix A.5 (shared `Attestation` rule + A.5.1 /
A.5.2 / A.5.3) + A.6 (Delegated-Compute Declaration + OC-70a mandates) +
A.7 (Cascade-scope enum); Matrix TR-OP-008/042..045 + TR-OP-005/006 flipped;
allowlist promotes #11/#14/#15 to hybrid. Validated through 3 opus-model
`/semi-formal-code-review` cycles; 15 blockers+warnings closed in-patch.

### Wave 1 (done)

4 parallel design-brief agents landed Streams A/B/C/D briefs; consolidated
in `thoughts/specs/2026-04-18-trellis-wave1-consolidation-plan.md`.

## Closed sprint-queue items

### Lint / fixture infrastructure — Wave 1 refactor plan (all 6 commits + renumbering guard)

Wave 1 lint-refactor plan: [`thoughts/specs/2026-04-18-trellis-wave1-lint-extension-plan.md`](thoughts/specs/2026-04-18-trellis-wave1-lint-extension-plan.md).

- **Lint-refactor commits 1-2** — shared plumbing + R1 fixture-naming guard
  + R3 projection-drills loader. Landed Wave 4 (30→52 pytest).
- **Lint-refactor commit 3** — R4-R5: projection/shred op dispatch +
  `tr_op` / `companion_sections` coverage lint. Landed Wave 5 working tree
  (`0fcee6f`).
- **Lint-refactor commit 4** — R6-R8: G-2 non-byte verification channels.
  R7 landed Wave 5; R6 spec-cross-ref (warning-not-error on uncited rows;
  non-resolving cites remain hard errors) + R8 model-check evidence (new
  `_pending-model-checks.toml` + `thoughts/model-checks/evidence.toml` path
  convention) landed in `d9f228a`.
- **Lint-refactor commit 5** — R9-R10: O-5 extension registry check + CDDL
  cross-ref. Landed Wave 8 (`b0f114d`).
- **Lint-refactor commit 6** — R11: O-4 declaration-doc Phase 1 static
  validator (frontmatter/schema, posture ref, authorized actions,
  event-registry stub, actor discriminator, runtime enclave, UTC bounds,
  signature table; ledger-replay checks deferred to G-4 Rust). Landed
  Wave 8 (`b0f114d`) with SSDI event-registry stub.
- **Pre-merge renumbering guard** — F6 amendment's complementary rule at
  merge time: `scripts/check-specs.py` enforces lifecycle fields, and
  `scripts/check-vector-renumbering.py` compares the current tree to a
  ratification/base ref to reject deleted or renumbered `<op>/NNN-*` vector
  prefixes. Landed Wave 5 working tree with CLI/git-path tests.
- **R12 verify-report consistency check** — Cross-checks failure-kind
  tokens in verify/* manifests against `[expected.report]` booleans per
  Core §19. Landed `d3af6a8`.
- **Generator `_lib/` extraction** — Shared byte-level plumbing
  centralized in
  [`fixtures/vectors/_generator/_lib/byte_utils.py`](fixtures/vectors/_generator/_lib/byte_utils.py).
  Renamed `gen_verify_002_003.py` → `gen_verify_negative_export_001.py`.
  Landed `b3cb833`.
- **Verify vectors 008 + 009** — Closed Core §19 step 5.d
  (`prev_checkpoint_hash` mismatch) and step 5.e (consistency-proof
  mismatch) with
  [`verify/008-export-001-prev-checkpoint-hash-mismatch`](fixtures/vectors/verify/008-export-001-prev-checkpoint-hash-mismatch)
  and
  [`verify/009-export-001-consistency-proof-mismatch`](fixtures/vectors/verify/009-export-001-consistency-proof-mismatch).
  Extended `gen_verify_negative_export_001.py`; lint + Trellis
  conformance replay pass.
- **Residual V3 breadth closure** — Landed the remaining G-3 fixture batch
  on 2026-04-21: `export/002-revoked-key-history`,
  `export/003-three-event-transition-chain`,
  `export/004-external-payload-optional-anchor`,
  `verify/010-export-002-revoked-key-after-valid-to`,
  `verify/011-export-003-transition-chain`,
  `verify/012-export-004-optional-anchor`,
  `tamper/009-prev-hash-break`, `tamper/010-missing-head`,
  `tamper/011-wrong-scope`, and `tamper/012-registry-snapshot-swap`.
  Also landed the Core §19 revocation-language pin, `trellis-verify`
  support for bundled `PayloadExternal` export members, and distinct
  `prev_hash_break` tamper classification. `python3 scripts/check-specs.py`,
  `cargo test -p trellis-verify`, and
  `cargo test -p trellis-conformance committed_vectors_match_the_rust_runtime`
  all pass, and ratification gate G-3 is now checked.

### First vector batch (G-3) — all 5 landed

Per [`thoughts/specs/2026-04-18-trellis-g3-first-batch-brainstorm.md`](thoughts/specs/2026-04-18-trellis-g3-first-batch-brainstorm.md).
Brainstorm corrected TODO's prior invariant mislabels. Serial order:
005 → 003 → 004 → 002 → tamper/001 (from 005, not 001).

- **`append/005-prior-head-chain`** — invariants #5, #10, #13;
  TR-CORE-020/023/050/080. Landed (`060a547`).
- **`append/003-external-payload-ref`** — invariants #4 + #8 partial + #13.
  `PayloadExternal` variant. Claims TR-CORE-031, -071. Landed (`905668b`).
- **`append/004-hpke-wrapped-inline`** — invariants #4 real + #8 populated
  + #11 latent. Real ChaCha20-Poly1305 payload encryption + HPKE suite-1
  DEK wrap with pinned X25519 recipient/ephemeral keys under `_keys/`.
  Landed Wave 8 (`4cc9fe8`) depending on Core amendments in `ee57780` (§9.4
  HPKE freshness + §6.4 AEAD pin + §9.4 test-vector carve-out). Claims
  TR-CORE-031, -038.
- **`append/002-rotation-signing-key`** — invariant #7 (key-bag immutable
  under rotation; not "key rotation" writ large). Claims TR-CORE-036, -038.
  Landed (`4585646`, rebased onto main from worktree).
- **`tamper/001-signature-flip`** (derived from `append/005`, not 001) —
  verification side; claims TR-CORE-061. Landed (`905668b`).

### `append/` residue batch (critical-path step 2)

Closed by Wave 7 `append/009-signing-key-revocation` (TR-CORE-037 +
TR-CORE-070). `pending_invariants = []` achieved.

### G-2 model-check flush

Closed 2026-04-21. `trellis-conformance` now carries a real model-check
suite at [`crates/trellis-conformance/src/model_checks.rs`](crates/trellis-conformance/src/model_checks.rs)
covering TR-CORE-001 / 020 / 023 / 025 / 046 / 050 and TR-OP-061 / 111.
`thoughts/model-checks/evidence.toml` and the row-specific evidence briefs
under `thoughts/model-checks/` are live, and
[`fixtures/vectors/_pending-model-checks.toml`](fixtures/vectors/_pending-model-checks.toml)
is empty.

### G-4 reference implementation

Closed 2026-04-21. The Rust workspace under `crates/` now provides real
`append`, `verify`, and `export` behavior, a real Postgres backend, and a
conformance harness that replays the committed `append`, `export`, `verify`,
`tamper`, `projection`, and `shred` corpora byte-for-byte. Ratification gate
G-4 is now checked in
[`ratification/ratification-checklist.md`](ratification/ratification-checklist.md).

## Closed stream items

### Stream B — O-3 projection discipline

- **`projection/002-rebuild-equivalence-minimal`** — Test 2 / TR-OP-005;
  first fixture exercising Core §15.3's new dCBOR rebuild pin. Landed
  (`905668b`).
- **`projection/003-cadence-positive-height` + `004-cadence-gap`** —
  Test 3 / TR-OP-008. Landed (`905668b`).
- **`shred/002-backup-refusal`** — Test 4 backup variant. Landed
  (`334bb75`).
- **`projection/005-watermark-staff-view-decision-binding`** — TR-OP-006 +
  §17.4 Staff-View. Final O-3 breadth item landed Wave 7.

### Stream C — O-4 delegated-compute honesty

- **Companion A.6 amendment to pin ambiguities** — Pinned
  key-absence-as-null for TOML nullable fields,
  `[signature] = {cose_sign1_b64, signer_kid, alg}` shape, and optional
  `audit.registry_ref`. Landed Wave 5 (`65090f8`).

### Stream D — O-5 posture-transition audit

- **Author O-5 fixtures** — All 6 cases landed: `append/006` CM-B→CM-A
  (TR-OP-042/045), `append/007` CM-C narrowing, `append/008`
  disclosure-profile A→B (TR-OP-043/045 + invariant #11), `tamper/002`
  from-state mismatch (TR-OP-044), `tamper/003` missing dual-attestation,
  `tamper/004` declaration-digest mismatch. Commits `dbdfe0a` + `814b2fe`.
  Semi-formal review (Wave 6) returned REQUEST CHANGES — minor, single
  blocking finding.
- **Reconcile `tamper_kind` enum naming** — Landed Wave 8 (`fd54232`):
  `tamper/004` uses canonical `posture_declaration_digest_mismatch`;
  Core §19 `failures[]` remains `declaration_digest_mismatch` (different
  layer).

### Stream E — Track E cross-cutting bindings

- **WOS `custodyHook` ↔ Trellis binding** (vision item 22). Core §23
  (4→8 subsections) + Companion §24 (OC-113a/b/c/d/e) + Appendix B.2
  extensions landed Wave 3C + Wave 4E (10 opus-review findings applied).
  Committed as `248781f`.

### Stream A — G-2 non-byte-testable invariant audit

Design at [`thoughts/specs/2026-04-18-trellis-g2-invariant-audit-paths.md`](thoughts/specs/2026-04-18-trellis-g2-invariant-audit-paths.md).
Hybrid classification; 11 byte-testable, 4 non-byte-only, 5 hybrid
invariants. No authoring tasks — Stream A closes when G-2 audit sign-off
lands.

## Wave 6 tail checklist (all closed in Wave 8 unless noted)

## Earlier closed items (pre-Wave 1)

- Core clarifications from T10 — §6.1 (`idempotency_key` uniqueness scope +
  UUIDv7 construction), §7.4 (COSE_Sign1 embedded payload, verifier MUST
  reject `payload == nil`), §9.1 (length-prefix form applies uniformly
  including single-component).
- Allowlist rollout — `TRELLIS_SKIP_COVERAGE=1` bypass removed;
  `_pending-invariants.toml` allowlist drives batched vector coverage
  (F5). `check_vector_manifest_paths` lint rule added (F7). 20/20 pytest
  green.
- Vector-lifecycle policy (F6) — renumbering-forbidden, `status =
  "deprecated"` tombstones, overlap-encouraged-as-boolean. Landed as F6
  amendment in
  `thoughts/specs/2026-04-18-trellis-g3-fixture-system-design.md` under
  "Vector lifecycle" + "Manifest schema"; lint enforcement deferred to the
  separate `check-specs.py` follow-on plan.
- Matrix drift for Core §6.8 / §10.6 / §14.6 closed; `append/001` coverage
  updated (`475b064`, `a1eb41f`).
- Working norms encoded in the handoff prompt (`c346313`).
- Ratification-evidence removed; normalization handoff archived (`617f9ae`,
